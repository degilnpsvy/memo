default mode and line echo mode. </P>
<P>In default mode, the program sends every character from keyboard immediately after it&#8217;s keyed in. The characters are not echoed locally. In line echo mode, characters are only sent when there is a newline. In other words, user can use backspace to modify the command before it&#8217;s sent.
