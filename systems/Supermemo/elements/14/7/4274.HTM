For example, if you want to align the section on a 0x10 byte boundary, so that the lowest four bits of the section address are zero, you could use something like the following declaration: 
<P></P>
<P>This declaration works because ALIGN returns the current location counter aligned upward to the specified value. Specifying an address for a section will change the value of the location counter<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">.</SPAN></SPAN>
