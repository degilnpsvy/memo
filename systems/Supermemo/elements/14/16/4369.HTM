The operating system&#8217;s own code and data are of course not accessible to user space programs. On some systems, this is done by putting them in a completely separate address space; on MIPS, <FONT class=clozed>the OS shares the same address space, and when the CPU is running at the user-program privilege level, access to these addresses is illegal and will trigger an exception.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>Note that while each process&#8217;s user space maps to its own private real storage, the privileged space is shared. The OS code and resources are seen at the same address by all processes&#8212;<FONT class=extract>an OS kernel is a multithreaded but single address-space system inside</FONT>&#8212;but each process&#8217;s user space addresses access its own separate space. Kernel routines running in process context are trusted to cooperate safely, but the application need not be trusted at all.<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; FONT-FAMILY: Minion-Regular-0-1000-19; mso-bidi-font-family: Minion-Regular-0-1000-19; mso-font-kerning: 0pt"></SPAN>
