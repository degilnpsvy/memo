Inside the user area, within the program&#8217;s sandbox, the OS provides more stack to the program on demand (implicitly, as the stack grows down). It will also provide a system call to make more data available, starting from the highest predeclared data addresses and growing up&#8212;systems people call this a heap.

<P>The heap feeds library functions, such as malloc(), that provide your program with chunks of extra memory. </P>
<P>Stack and heap are supplied in chunks small enough to be reasonably thrifty with system memory but big enough to avoid too many system calls or exceptions.
