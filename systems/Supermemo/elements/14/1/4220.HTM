As originally conceived, the CPU always came with an L2 cache (the cache memory was off chip, but the L2 controller is included with the CPU), and it used the L2 cache to detect L1-cache aliases. If you loaded an alias to a line that was already present in the L1, the CPU generated an exception, which could be used to clean up.</SPAN></P>

Contemporary UNIX systems had a fairly stylized way of using virtual memory, which meant that you could control memory allocation to avoid ever loading an alias. In retrospect we can see that generating aliases is a bug, and the careful memory management was a workaround for it. But it worked, and people forgot, and it became a feature.</SPAN></P>

As the years go past, Linux is expected to offer more exciting facilities. Programmers struggle to fix the places where aliases can break legitimate code, but as new facilities are added to the OS, it breaks again. I think the CPU designers are now recognizing that relying on software workarounds for aliases creates maintenance problems: Increasingly, new CPUs have at least the D-cache alias-free.</SPAN></P>
