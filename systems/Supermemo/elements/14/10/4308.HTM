In the particular case of the exception used to implement a system call, it&#8217;s not really necessary to save GP registers at all (so long as the exception handler doesn&#8217;t overwrite the s0&#8211;s8 &#8220;saved&#8221; registers, that is). In a system call or any noninterrupt exception, you can call straight out to code running in thread context.
