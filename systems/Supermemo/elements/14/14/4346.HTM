File: </P>
<P>A named chunk of data. In GNU/Linux, most of the interactions a program makes with the world beyond its process are done by reading and writing files. Files can just be things you write data to and get it back later. But there are also special files that lead to device drivers: Read one of those and the data comes from a keyboard, write another you&#8217;re your data is interpreted as digital audio and sent out to a loudspeaker. The Linux kernel likes to avoid too many new system calls, so special /proc files are also used to allow applications to get information about the kernel.
