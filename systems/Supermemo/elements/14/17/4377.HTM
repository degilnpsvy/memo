<P>1, It stashes away the restart location in a special register, </P>
<P>2, modifies the machine state just enough to let you find out what happened </P>
<P>3, and to disallow further interrupts, </P>
<P>4, then jumps to a single predefined location in low memory. </P>
<P>Everything else is up to the software.
