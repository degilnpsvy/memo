<P class=Default style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">RLX-VM is a Virtual Machine (VM) based on SystemCTM (http://www.accellera.org) to simulate a whole SOC system. Some common components, such as UART, Timer are modeled in this VM. RLX-VM is helpful to both hardware engineer and software engineer. Hardware engineer can use RLX-VM to evaluate if some hardware architecture can work, or if its performance is satisfying. Software engineer can develop firmware/application program on RLX-VM before the hardware is ready. Software engineers can have more time in their tight schedule with RLX-VM. </SPAN></P>
<P class=Default style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'">RLX-VM simulates SOC system at the transaction abstraction level to achieve high simulation speed. Most components are abstracted at OCP TL2 level. Detailed information about OCP TL2 can be found in the document &#8220;A SystemCTM OCP Transaction Level Communication Channel&#8221; from OCPIP (http://www.ocpip.org/). </SPAN>
