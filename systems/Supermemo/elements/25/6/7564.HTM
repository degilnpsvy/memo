MEM Is the stage where the instruction can read/write memory variables in the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. On average, about three out of four instructions do nothing in this stage, but allocating the stage for each instruction ensures that you never get two instructions wanting the data cache at the same time. (It&#8217;s the same as the mushy peas served by Dionysus.)
