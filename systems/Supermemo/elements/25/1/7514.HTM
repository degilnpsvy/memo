You can provide a log message on the command line, but it&#8217;s more typical to create the message during an interactive editor session. This gives you an opportunity to compose a complete and detailed log message in your favorite editor. To configure Git to open your favorite editor during a git commit, set your GIT_EDITOR environment variable.
