So long as the CPU runs from the cache, the execution of every MIPS instruction is divided into five phases, called pipe stages, with each pipestage taking a fixed amount of time. The fixed amount of time is usually a processor clock cycle (though some actions take only half a clock, so <FONT class=extract>the MIPS five-stage pipeline actually occupies only four clock cycles</FONT>).
