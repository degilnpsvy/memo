<P class=docText>Shell mode also provides a few convenient shortcuts. The command <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> retrieves the last shell command you typed, no matter how far back in the buffer it is. Typing successive <SPAN class=docEmphBold><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SPAN>'s brings back earlier commands.
