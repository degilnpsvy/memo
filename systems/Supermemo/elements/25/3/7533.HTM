type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-c</SPAN> to terminate the current job. Likewise, under Unix, you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-z</SPAN> to stop a job, instead of <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-z</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-d</SPAN> instead of <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN>, and so on. (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-d</SPAN> is not strictly necessary because Emacs understands <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN> in context. If you're at the end of the buffer, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN> means "end of file"; if you're anywhere else, it deletes a character.)
