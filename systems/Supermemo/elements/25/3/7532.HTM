<P class=docText>In Emacs shell mode,&nbsp;a few tricks are worth knowing, though. For example, you normally interrupt a command by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN>. If you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> in shell mode, Emacs thinks that the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> is part of a command meant for it, because many Emacs commands start with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN>. Therefore, you have to <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>Alternatively, you can select options from the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Signals</SPAN> menu rather than using control characters, if desired (for example, selecting <SPAN class=docEmphBold>EOF</SPAN> instead of typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN>).
