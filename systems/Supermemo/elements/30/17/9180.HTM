<P class=docText>Sometimes it's more convenient to edit a directory and its subdirectories in the same buffer. To insert a subdirectory in the current Dired buffer, move to it and press <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. Emacs inserts the subdirectory at the end of the buffer. If you insert more subdirectories in this fashion, they will appear in alphabetical order at the end of the buffer.
