<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>The final feature we'll cover is <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-e</SPAN>, (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-expand</SPAN>). Like the conditional compilation motion commands (e.g., <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-u</SPAN> for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-up-conditional</SPAN>), <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-expand</SPAN> helps you answer the often difficult question, "What code actually gets compiled?" when your source code contains a morass of preprocessor directives.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText>To use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-expand</SPAN>, you must first define a region. Then, when you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-e</SPAN>, it takes the code within the region, passes it through the actual C preprocessor, and places the output in a window called <TT>*Macroexpansion*</TT>.</P>
<P class=docText>To see how this procedure works, let's go back to the code example from earlier in this chapter that contains C preprocessor directives:</P><PRE>#define LUCYX
#define BADEXIT -1

#ifdef LUCYX
    *ptyv = open ("/dev/ptc", O_RDWR | O_NDELAY, 0);
    if (fd &lt; 0)
        return BADEXIT;
#else
    fprintf (stderr, "You can't do that on this system!");
#endif
</PRE><PRE>If you define a region around this chunk of code and type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-e</SPAN>, you see following the message:</PRE><PRE>Invoking /lib/cpp -C on region...
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>followed by this:</P><PRE>done
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>Then you see a <TT>*Macroexpansion*</TT> window that contains this result:</P><PRE>    *ptyv = open ("/dev/ptc", O_RDWR | O_NDELAY, 0);
    if (fd &lt; 0)
        return -1;
</PRE>
<P class=docText>If you want to use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-expand</SPAN> with a different C preprocessor command, instead of the default <SPAN class=docEmphBold>/lib/cpp -C</SPAN> (the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>-C</SPAN> option means "preserve comments in the output"), you can set the variable <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-preprocessor</SPAN>. For example, if you want to use an experimental preprocessor whose filename is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/usr/local/lib/cpp</SPAN>, put the following line in your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file:</P><PRE>(setq c-macro-preprocessor "/usr/local/lib/cpp -C")
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>It's highly recommended that you keep the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>-C</SPAN> option for not deleting comments in your code.
