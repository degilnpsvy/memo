<P class=docText>With <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>C-c C-u</FONT></SPAN>, you can tell instantly what preprocessor conditional governs the code in question. Consider this code block: </P>
<P class=docText>Imagine that the ellipses ( . . . ) represent hundreds of lines of code. Now suppose you are trying to determine under what conditions the file /dev/ptc is opened. If your cursor is on that line of code, you can type C-c C-u, and the cursor moves to the line #ifdef LUCYX&#8212;telling you that the code is compiled if you're on a LUCYX system. If you want to skip the code that would not be compiled and go directly to the end of the conditional, type C-c C-n. We will see another command that is useful for dealing with C preprocessor code later in this section.</P><PRE>#define LUCYX
#define BADEXIT -1
#ifdef LUCYX
    ...
    *ptyv = open ("/dev/ptc", O_RDWR | O_NDELAY, 0);
    if (fd &lt; 0)
        return BADEXIT;
    ...
#else
    ...
    fprintf (stderr, "You can't do that on this system!");
