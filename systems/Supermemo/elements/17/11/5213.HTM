MIPS L1 caches are always separated into an I- and a D-cache; the selection is done purely by function, in that instruction fetches look in the I-cache and data loads/stores in the D-cache. (This means, by the way, that if you try to execute code that the CPU just copied into memory, you must <FONT class=clozed>both write back those instructions out of the D-cache and invalidate the I-cache locations,</FONT> to make sure you really execute the new instructions.)</SPAN>
