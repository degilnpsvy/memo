Using git rm 
<P></P>
<P>The command git rm is, naturally the inverse of git add. It removes a file from <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. However, because removing a file tends to be more problematic (if something goes wrong) than adding a file, Git treats the removal of a file with a bit more care. </P>
<P>Git will remove a file only from the index or from the index and working directory simultaneously. Git will not remove a file just from the working directory; the regular rm command may be used for that purpose.
