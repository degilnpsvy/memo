The first is that the entry translates a pair of virtual pages, and maybe only one of them ought to be there. The other is that the software routine that refills the TLB is optimized for speed and doesn&#8217;t want to check for special cases. When some further processing is needed before a program can use a page referred to by the memory-held table, the memory-held entry can be left marked invalid. After TLB refill, this will cause a different kind of trap, invoking special processing without having to put a test in every software refill event.
