<SPAN class=docemphbold>Ctrl</SPAN> commands generally move in smaller units than their associated <SPAN class=docemphbold>Meta</SPAN> commands. For example, <SPAN class=docemphbold>C-b</SPAN> moves the cursor backward one character, whereas <SPAN class=docemphbold>M-b</SPAN> moves the cursor back one word. Likewise, <SPAN class=docemphbold>C-a</SPAN> moves to the beginning of the line, whereas <SPAN class=docemphbold>M-a</SPAN> moves to the beginning of a sentence.
