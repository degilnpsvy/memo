lui: Load upper immediate. 
<P></P>
<P>The 16-bit constant is loaded into bits 16&#8211;31 of a register, with bits 32&#8211;63 (if applicable) set equal to bit 31 and bits 0&#8211;15 cleared. </P>
<P>This instruction is one-half of the pair of machine instructions that load an arbitrary 32-bit constant. Assembly programmers will probably never write this explicitly; it is used implicitly for macros like li (load immediate), la (load address), and above all for implementing useful addressing modes.
