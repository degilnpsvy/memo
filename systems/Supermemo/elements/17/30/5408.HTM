The MIPS implementation of precise exceptions is quite costly, because it limits the scope for pipelining. That&#8217;s particularly painful in the FPU, because floating-point operations often take many pipeline stages to run. The instruction following a MIPS FP instruction can&#8217;t be allowed to <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> until the hardware can be sure that the FP instruction won&#8217;t produce an exception.
