3.4.3 Hazards between CP0 Instructions </P>
<P>Any mfc0 instruction is explicitly dependent on the value in a CP0 register, but because all TLB information is staged through registers, so are tlbwi, tlbwr, and tlbr. Similarly, those cache instructions that read data out of CP0 registers are dependent. </P>
<P>Less obviously, tlbp depends on EntryHi because of its ASID field. All these are execution hazards and can be made safe with an ehb, placed before the consuming CP0 instruction. If you have the chance to put it a few instructions early in the sequence, so much the better (some CPUs may inhibit all CP0 operations for a few clocks after an ehb).
