<P>All that output means that Git has taken your master branch changes, bundled them up, and sent them to the remote repository named origin. Git has also performed one more step here: it has taken those same changes and added them to the origin/master branch in your repository as well. In effect, Git has caused the changes that were originally on your master branch to be sent to the remote repository and then has requested that they be brought back onto the origin/master remote-tracking branch as well.
