We could simply decide that the high bits should be undefined; when you&#8217;re being MIPS32 compatible, the high bits of registers can contain any old garbage. This is easy to achieve but fails the third test above: We would need separate MIPS32 and MIPS64 versions of <FONT class=clozed>test instructions and conditional branches (they test registers for equality, or for being negative, by looking at the top bit&#8212;and that&#8217;s either bit 31 or bit 63).</FONT>
