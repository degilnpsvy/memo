4.7 L2 and L3 Caches </P>
<P>In larger systems, there&#8217;s often a nested hierarchy of caches. A small and fast L1 or primary cache is close to the CPU. Accesses that miss in the L1 cache are looked up not directly in memory but in an L2 or secondary cache&#8212;typically several times bigger and several times slower than the L1 (but still several times faster than the main memory). The number of levels of hierarchy that might be useful depends on how slow main memory is compared with the CPU&#8217;s fastest access; with CPU cycle times falling much faster than memory access times, 2006 desktop systems commonly have L3 cache. 2006 embedded systems, trailing desktop speeds by several years (and different constraints, particularly for power consumption and heat dissipation) are only just getting around to using L2 caches outside a few specialist high-end applications.
