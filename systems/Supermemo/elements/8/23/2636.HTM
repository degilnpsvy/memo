You can change category templates later by means of <FONT class=clozed>Search : Categories</FONT>. Template for items will determine the look of your question-answer items in the category. You can also choose other template formats for items (e.g. occlusion test, multiple choice test, etc.). Template for topics will determine how your category articles will look like (e.g. when you import them with Ctrl+N in incremental reading)
