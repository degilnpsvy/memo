The purpose of the prefix identifier is to roughly categorize the items of interest into separate projects. The use of a prefix is to isolate proprietary source codes from public-domain ones and to indicate which project the particular file, function, or variable belongs to. The choice of prefix should come from a group-wise consensus. The list of proposed prefix is shown as follows: 
<P></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>. rsdk: for RSDK project </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>. rlxsc | rsc | sc: for RLX SystemC project </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>. rlxsim | rsim | iss | sim: for RLX Simulator project</FONT>
