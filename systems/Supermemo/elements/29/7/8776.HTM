If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort column will summarize the estimated work effort for each day<A style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none" href="http://orgmode.org/org.html#fn-89" rel=footnote name=fnd-89><SUP>89</SUP></A>, and you can use this to find space in your schedule. To get an overview of the entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the option<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE>org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum</CODE>. The appointments on a day that take place over a specified time interval will then also be added to the load estimate of the day. </P>
<P>Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is triggered with the / key in the agenda (see Agenda commands). If you have these estimates defined consistently, two or three key presses will narrow down the list to stuff that fits into an available time slot.
