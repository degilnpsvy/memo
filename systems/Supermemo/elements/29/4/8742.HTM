These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic Boolean logic like &#8216;+boss+urgent-project1&#8217;, to find entries with tags &#8216;boss&#8217; and &#8216;urgent&#8217;, but not &#8216;project1&#8217;, or &#8216;Kathy|Sally&#8217; to find entries which are tagged, like &#8216;Kathy&#8217; or &#8216;Sally&#8217;. The full syntax of the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO keywords, entry levels and properties.
