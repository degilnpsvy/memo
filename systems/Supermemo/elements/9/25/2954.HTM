One trick that can be useful when you are experimenting with regular expressions and trying to get the hang of them is to type some text into <FONT class=clozed>a scratch buffer </FONT>that corresponds to what you're trying to match, and then use <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>to build up the regular expression. The interactive, immediate feedback of an incremental search can show you the pieces of the regular expression in action in a way that is completely unique to Emacs.</SPAN>
