On machines like the MIPS, which cannot do 8- or 16-bit precision arithmetic directly, expressions involving short or char variables require the compiler to insert extra instructions to make sure things <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>; this is nearly always undesirable and rather inefficient.When porting code that uses small integer variables to a MIPS CPU, you should consider identifying which variables can be safely changed to int.
