<FONT class=extract>The Index register&nbsp;low bits hold the TLB index.</FONT> ( Ancient R2000-compatible CPUs had a different register layout, with the index offset, starting from bit 8 upward. You&#8217;re unlikely to meet one of those.) <FONT class=extract>Not many bits are needed, since no MIPS CPU has yet had a TLB with more than 128 entries.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The high bit (bit 31) is magic, being set by tlbp when the probe fails to finds a matching entry. Bit 31 is a good choice&#8212;because it makes the value appear negative, it&#8217;s easy to test for.</FONT>
