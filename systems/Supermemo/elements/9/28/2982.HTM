Restart the CPU earlier: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>A naive CPU will remain stalled until the whole cache line is filled with new data. But you can arrange that data from memory is passed both to the cache and directly to the waiting CPU, and have the CPU restart as soon as the data it is waiting for arrives. The rest of the cache refill continues in parallel with CPU activity. Many MIPS CPUs enhance this by passing the address of the word whose request triggered the cache miss to the memory controller and having the critical word of the block returned first (&#8220;critical word first&#8221;)<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Minion-Regular-0-1000-20; mso-bidi-font-family: Minion-Regular-0-1000-20; mso-font-kerning: 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>.</SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
