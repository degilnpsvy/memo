You get a richer programming environment, task-to-task protection that can be very valuable when integrating a system, and probably cleaner interfaces. Is that worth devoting extra memory and CPU power to, and losing a degree of control over timing, for the benefits of the cleverer system? Builders of TV set-top boxes, DVD players, and domestic network routers have found Linux worthwhile: Other systems (not necessarily of very different complexity) are still habitually using simpler systems.</SPAN></P>
