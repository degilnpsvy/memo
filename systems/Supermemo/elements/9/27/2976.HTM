Ever since the move to on-chip caches in the early 1990s, the performance of high-end CPUs has been to a large extent determined by the efficiency of their cache systems. In many current systems (particularly embedded systems, where there&#8217;s a need to economize on cache sizes and memory performance) the CPU is waiting for a cache refill for 50 percent to 65 percent of its time. At this point, doubling the performance of the CPU core will deliver only a 15 percent to 25 percent increase in application performance.
