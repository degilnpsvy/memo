Many of the tcsh environment variables are duplicates of the shell variable of the same name. This is to provide some compatibility with the Bourne shell environment (note the inclusion of the PATH environment variable, which uses the same format as the Bourne shell PATH environment variable). </P>
<P>However, the two aren&#8217;t linked together. If you change one, the other won&#8217;t change. Thus you can cause all sorts of problems by setting a shell variable (such as path) without setting the corresponding environment variable (PATH).
