All data items declared by C code will be correctly aligned. Where you know in advance that you want to code a transfer from an address whose alignment is unknown and that may turn out to be unaligned, the architecture does allow for a two-instruction sequence (much more efficient than a series of byte loads, shifts, and adds). The operation of the constituent instructions is obscure and hard to grasp, but they are normally generated by the macro-instruction <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. They&#8217;re described fully in section 8.5.1.
