Because CISC architectures such as the MC680x0 and Intel x86 do handle unaligned loads and stores, you may come across this as a problem when porting software; in extremity, you may even decide to install a trap handler that will emulate the desired load operation and hide this feature from the application&#8212;but that&#8217;s going to be horribly slow unless the references are very rare.
