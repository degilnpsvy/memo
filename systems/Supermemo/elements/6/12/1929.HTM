For example, if you write a lot of letters, you could have a macro that prints out a template and then pauses for you to fill in variables (such as the date and the recipient's name). You can perform this task (and similar tasks) by inserting <FONT class=clozed>a recursive edit </FONT>into a macro. A recursive edit is just a fancy way to say, "Stop and let me type a while, then pick up the macro where I left off."
