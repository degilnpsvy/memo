Type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k n</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>name-last-kbd-macro</SPAN>). Now type a name for your macro and press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>. A non-Emacs sounding name is best so that Emacs doesn't confuse it with one of its own commands. Once you've executed this command, Emacs remembers the macro for the rest of the editing session. To use it again, type the command <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphasis>name</SPAN> (where <SPAN class=docEmphasis>name</SPAN> is the name you've chosen). Emacs treats your named macro like one of its own commands; it shows up in completion lists if you press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Tab</SPAN> after typing a few letters of the name.
