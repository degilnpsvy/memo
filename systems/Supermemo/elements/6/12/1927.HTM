For example, let's say that you have defined a macro called <SPAN class=docEmphBold>transpose-names</SPAN> and placed it in the file <SPAN class=docEmphasis>html.macs</SPAN>, in the directory <SPAN class=docEmphasis>~/macros</SPAN>. Add this line to your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file to load your macros automatically:</P><PRE><FONT class=clozed> (load-file "~/macros/html.macs")</FONT>
