<P class=docText>If you invoke a macro and it does the wrong thing, you can use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-_</SPAN> to undo it. Emacs is smart enough to realize that "undo the last command" means "undo the entire macro" rather than "undo the last command within the macro." However, if you repeat a macro multiple times using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-</SPAN><SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-_</SPAN> undoes only the last instance of the macro, not all the instances
