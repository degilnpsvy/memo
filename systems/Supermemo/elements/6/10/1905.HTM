<P class=docText>Here are a few points to remember:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Don't forget to press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>F4</SPAN> or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x )</SPAN> when you've finished the macro. If you try to execute a macro before it has been defined, Emacs complains and forgets the macro's definition.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-g</SPAN> terminates a macro, causing Emacs to forget its definition.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Virtually any error automatically terminates a macro. If Emacs beeps at you, you have to start over.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Emacs executes the keystrokes <SPAN class=docEmphasis>exactly</SPAN> as you type them, with no intelligence whatsoever. Avoid making assumptions like, "Of course I'll be at the beginning (or end) of the line when I execute the macro."</P></LI></UL>
