<P class=docText>Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c }</SPAN> moves you past the right brace. It always finds the correct closing brace, given your current position. If there is no closing brace, you get an error message that says <TT>Scan error: Unbalanced parentheses</TT>. You also get this error message if you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c }</SPAN> while the cursor is in a section that is not surrounded by braces, which can be a little confusing.
