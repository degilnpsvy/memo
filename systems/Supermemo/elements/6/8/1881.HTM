<P class=docText>Often you want to select <A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2211></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2212></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2213></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2214></A>related files and either archive them, move them, compress them, or just delete them. Typically, you use wildcards to select multiple files. In Dired, you use regular expressions. To mark a group of files whose filenames match a regular expression, press <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>%</SPAN> followed by <SPAN class=docEmphBold>m</SPAN></FONT> to mark them with an asterisk.
