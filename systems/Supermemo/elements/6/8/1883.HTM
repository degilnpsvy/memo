First, select the files you want to include in the query-replace, then press <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>Q</FONT></SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>dired-do-query-replace</SPAN>). Put in the search string, then the replacement string (the strings can be plain text or a regular expression) and Emacs starts a query-replace that moves you through each file sequentially. Here's the only hitch: if you interrupt the query-replace with a recursive edit, you can't restart it without going back to the Dired buffer.
