<P class=docText>Sometimes it's more useful to mark files whose <SPAN class=docEmphasis>contents</SPAN> match a given regular expression. To mark files that contain a certain regular expression, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>% g</FONT></SPAN>, followed by the regular expression to match (think <SPAN class=docEmphasis>g</SPAN> for <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN> if you're familiar with <SPAN class=docEmphasis>grep</SPAN>).
