Now let's move the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ch</SPAN> files we marked into the new directory. We'll use the <FONT class=clozed>rename(R)</FONT> command. This command, like the Unix <SPAN class=docEmphBold>mv</SPAN> command, is used for renaming files and for moving them. Because we have marked more than one file with an asterisk, when we type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>R</SPAN>, Emacs assumes we mean to move the marked files.
