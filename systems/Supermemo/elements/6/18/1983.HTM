you can type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-j</SPAN> instead of <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>, at the end of a line, and Emacs indents the next line properly for you. This indentation is controlled by the variable <SPAN class=docEmphBold>left-margin</SPAN>, whose value is the column to indent to. Much the same thing happens in programming language modes, but the process is more flexible and complex.
