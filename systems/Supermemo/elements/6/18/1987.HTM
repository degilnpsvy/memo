For example, if you are closing out a statement block or function body, you can press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-j</SPAN> (or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>) and type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>}</SPAN>, and Emacs lines it up with its matching <SPAN class=docEmphBold>{</SPAN>. This eliminates the need for you to scroll back through the code to find out what column the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>{</SPAN> is in.
