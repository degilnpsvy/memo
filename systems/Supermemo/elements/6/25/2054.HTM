When you are using Emacs, you delineate regions by setting the mark and moving the cursor. However, region-oriented functions (such as&nbsp;kill-region,&nbsp;indent-region, and&nbsp;shell-command-on-region&#8212;really, any function with&nbsp;region&nbsp;in its name) are actually more flexible when used within Emacs Lisp code. They typically take <FONT class=clozed>two integer arguments that are used as the character positions of the boundaries</FONT> for the region on which they operate. These arguments default to the values of point and mark when the functions are called interactively.
