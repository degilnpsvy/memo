<FONT class=extract>You define the macro and execute it on a region by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k r</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>apply-macro-to-region-lines</SPAN>).</FONT> Remember that earlier we said that macros should set themselves up to repeat? This command is <FONT class=clozed>different because it expects to work on one line at a time. You don't want to set it up to repeat by moving to the next line; it does that automatically.</FONT>
