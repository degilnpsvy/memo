<P class=docText>You can edit a macro and <A name=gnu3-CHP-6-ITERM-2269></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-6-ITERM-2270></A>make changes to it in a few different ways. For this example, we chose an all-purpose editing command, <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>edit-kbd-macro</SPAN>, which is bound to <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k e</SPAN></FONT>. Several macro editing commands are available, but this one works for all types of macros, so it's good to learn.
