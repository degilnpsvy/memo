<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>For example, to bind our transpose names macro to <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k T</SPAN>, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k b</SPAN>. Emacs prompts for the key binding. Type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k T Enter</SPAN>. Emacs confirms, <TT>Keyboard macro bound to C-x C-k T</TT>.</FONT> Binding a macro command to a key in this way works for only one session.
