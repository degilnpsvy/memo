<P class=docText>Windows are sometimes useful in macros, but, again, you have to watch out. It's better to start a macro with one window on the screen, have the macro open other windows, and finally close all but one window (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x 1</SPAN>). If you write a macro with two windows on the screen and later try to execute it with four windows on the screen, the results will be unpredictable at best! In general, moving to a named buffer, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x b</SPAN> <TT><I>buffername</I></TT>, is preferable to moving to the "other" window using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x o</SPAN> (too vague to be generally useful). The other window could be anything&#8212;a <TT>*Help*</TT> buffer, <TT>*Completion*</TT> buffer, <TT>*shell*</TT> buffer, and so on. Moving to a named buffer always gets you to the right place, no matter how (or whether) the buffer is displayed.
