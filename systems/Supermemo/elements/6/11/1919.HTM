<P class=docText>In a more general sense, you can cycle to the previously defined macro by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-k C-p</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>kmacro-cycle-ring-previous</SPAN>). To move the ring the other way, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k C-n</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>kmacro-cycle-ring-next</SPAN>). The familiar <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN> for previous and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-n</SPAN> for next bindings are appended to the general macro keyboard prefix <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-k</SPAN>.
