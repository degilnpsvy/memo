If you press Enter, f, or j, Emacs displays the bookmarked file with the cursor in the bookmarked location. From the bookmark list, press d to mark bookmarks for deletion, then x to delete them (unlike in the buffer list, in the bookmark list, deleting is the only reason you need the x command). If you change your mind, press Del to remove the d before you press x. Pressing r renames a bookmark, and Emacs prompts you for the new name. To save all the bookmarks, press s. You can mark several bookmarks and then display their associated files by typing m next to the bookmarks. A &gt; appears beside bookmarks you've marked. When you've marked all you want, type v (for view) and Emacs pulls up the files associated with the bookmarks and displays them in multiple windows (with the cursor at the bookmarked location, of course). If you just want to move to one bookmarked file, you can press v without marking the bookmark first.
