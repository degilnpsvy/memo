<P class=docText>When you're in the calendar, Emacs <A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2236></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2237></A>sensibly moves by day rather than by character. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> moves you to the next day; <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-b</SPAN> moves you to the previous day. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-n</SPAN> moves you to the same day of the next week; <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN> moves you back a week. The arrow keys work the same way. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-}</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-{</SPAN> move forward and backward by month, and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x [</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x ]</SPAN> move forward and backward by year. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-v</SPAN> scrolls forward by three months; <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-v</SPAN> scrolls back three months.
