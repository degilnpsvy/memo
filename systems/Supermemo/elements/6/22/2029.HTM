you need to get Emacs to evaluate the lines you typed in, thereby actually defining the function. To do this, move your cursor to just after the last closing parenthesis in the function and type<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SPAN> &#8212;the "evaluate" key in Lisp interaction mode&#8212;to tell Emacs to perform the function definition. You should see the name of the function appear again in the buffer; the return value of the<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class=docemphbold>defun</SPAN><SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>function is the symbol that has been defined. (If instead you get an error message, double check that your function looks exactly like the example and that you haven't typed in the line numbers, and try again.)
