<P class=docText>To check for mismatched curly braces and dollar signs, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x tex-validate-buffer Enter</SPAN>. This command checks the entire buffer for unbalanced parentheses, curly braces, dollar signs, and the like. (If you have a large file, you might want to validate a region instead using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x tex-validate-region Enter</SPAN>). If it finds any errors, Emacs displays an <TT>*Occur*</TT> buffer with <TT>Mismatches</TT>: at the top and a list of lines on which it found errors. You can then easily move to each line that contains an error with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x goto-line</SPAN>.
