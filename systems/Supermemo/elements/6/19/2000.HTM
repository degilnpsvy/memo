<H3 class=docSection1Title>9.4. Java Support</H3>
<P class=docText>As we mentioned earlier, recent versions of Emacs come with support for Java built-in (Java mode is based on cc-mode). We'll explore Java mode briefly and then take a more in-depth look at the <A name=gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2579></A>Java Development Environment for Emacs (JDEE).</P><A name=gnu3-CHP-9-SECT-4.1></A>
<H4 class=docSection2Title>9.4.1 Java Mode</H4>
<P class=docText>Java mode shares all of the<A name=gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2580></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2581></A> formatting and font features mentioned above, but understands the Java language specifically. You get thrown into Java mode when opening any <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.java</SPAN> file.</P>
<P class=docText>When working in Java mode, you have exactly the same features available as you do in C mode. Syntax highlighting handles Java keywords and syntax when font-lock mode is turned on. You can navigate Java commands using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-a</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-e</SPAN>. When commenting out a region, it uses the C++ style <SPAN class=docEmphBold>//</SPAN> comments.</P>
<P class=docText>You'll notice a small augmentation in the indent alignment commands if you choose to spread your <SPAN class=docEmphBold>throws</SPAN> or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>extends</SPAN> clauses over multiple lines. For example, consider the following method declaration:</P><PRE>public Object getNetResource(String host, int port, String resName) 


throws IllegalArgumentException, 


IOException, 


SQLException, 


FileNotFoundException


{
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>If you <FONT class=extract>mark the region and run <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-C-\</SPAN> to indent the region</FONT>, it uses a special alignment for the exception list:</P><PRE>public Object getNetResource(String host, int port, String resName) 


        throws IllegalArgumentException, 


               IOException, 


               SQLException, 


               FileNotFoundException


{
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>It all works like it is supposed to&#8212;just with Java as the language at the core of the action. However, for more than casual Java editing, you should read the next section on the JDEE.
