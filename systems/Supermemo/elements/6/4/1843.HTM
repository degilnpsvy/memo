<P class=docText>Shell mode also provides a few convenient shortcuts. The command <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>M-p</FONT></SPAN> retrieves the last shell command you typed, no matter how far back in the buffer it is. Typing successive <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-p</SPAN>'s brings back earlier commands.
