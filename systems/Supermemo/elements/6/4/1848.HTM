<P class=docText>When you're writing a book, moving by paragraphs makes sense, but when you're using a shell, moving <A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2145></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2146></A>by output group is more helpful. An <SPAN class=docEmphasis>output group</SPAN> consists of a command and its output. To move to the previous output group, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>C-c C-p</FONT></SPAN>. To move to the next output group, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>C-c C-n</FONT></SPAN>.
