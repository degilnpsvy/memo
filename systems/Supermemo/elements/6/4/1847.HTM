<P class=docText>Another useful command for shell mode is <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-r</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>comint-show-output</SPAN>)</FONT>. This command is useful if a command produces a lot of output and causes the first few lines of output to scroll off the screen. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-r</SPAN> repositions the window so the first line of output from your last command is at the top of the window. If you want to see the end of the output instead, type <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-e</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>comint-show-maximum-output</SPAN>)</FONT>; this command moves the last line of the input to the bottom of the window.
