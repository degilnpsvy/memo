<P class=docText>The previous command (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>ls-la</SPAN>) remains on the screen, but its output, a long list of files, is deleted. <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>C-c C-o</FONT></SPAN> can delete output from only the most recent command; it can't delete output from your previous commands.
