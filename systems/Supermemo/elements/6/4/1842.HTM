<P class=docText>In Emacs shell mode,&nbsp;a few tricks are worth knowing, though. For example, you normally interrupt a command by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN>. If you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> in shell mode, Emacs thinks that the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> is part of a command meant for it, because many Emacs commands start with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN>. Therefore, you have to <FONT class=clozed>type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-c</SPAN> to terminate the current job. Likewise, under Unix, you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-z</SPAN> to stop a job, instead of <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-z</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-d</SPAN> instead of <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN>, and so on. (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-d</SPAN> is not strictly necessary because Emacs understands <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN> in context. If you're at the end of the buffer, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN> means "end of file"; if you're anywhere else, it deletes a character.) </FONT>Alternatively, you can select options from the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Signals</SPAN> menu rather than using control characters, if desired (for example, selecting <SPAN class=docEmphBold>EOF</SPAN> instead of typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN>).
