<P class=docText>Emacs also has an option that automatically selects "garbage" files. By default, this includes files with the following extensions: <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.log</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.toc</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.dvi</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.bak</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.orig</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.rej</SPAN>. Garbage files are defined by a regular expression, which is contained in the variable <SPAN class=docEmphBold>dired-garbage-files-regexp</SPAN>; you can change the value of this variable to define garbage files as you see fit (after all, one man's junk is another man's treasure).
