<P class=docText>Usually, asterisks (*) and question <A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2191></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2192></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2193></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2194></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2195></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2196></A>marks are used as wildcards in commands. In Dired, they have a special meaning. An asterisk means <FONT class=clozed>"use the file I'm on or the files I've marked"; that way you don't have to type filenames explicitly</FONT>. When multiple files are marked, a question mark means to run this command <FONT class=clozed>separately on each file</FONT>.
