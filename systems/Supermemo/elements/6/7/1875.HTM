<FONT class=extract>When you want to do something else with a group of files, you first mark them with an asterisk.</FONT> Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>m</SPAN> marks the file the cursor is on; an asterisk appears where you normally see a D. Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>3m</SPAN> marks this file and the next two files. Once you mark files with an asterisk, Emacs assumes that any command you issue is meant for these files. So if you have three files marked with an asterisk and press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Z</SPAN> to compress, Emacs assumes you want to compress those three files. After the compression, the files remain marked with asterisks.
