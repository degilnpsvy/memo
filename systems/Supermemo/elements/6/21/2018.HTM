Line 4 calls goto-char. The argument to goto-char is a (nested) function call to the built-in function point-min. As we have mentioned before, point is Emacs's internal name for the position of the cursor, and we'll refer to the cursor as point throughout the remainder of this chapter. point-min returns the value of the first character position in the current buffer, which is almost always 1; then, goto-char is called with the value 1, which has the effect of moving point to the beginning of the buffer.</SPAN>
