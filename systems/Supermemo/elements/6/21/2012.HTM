The defun defines the function by its name and arguments. <FONT class=extract>Notice that defun is itself a function&#8212;one that, when called, defines a new function. (defun returns the name of the function defined, as a symbol.)</FONT> The function's arguments appear as a list of names inside parentheses. Arguments can be made optional by preceding them with the keyword &amp;optional. If an argument is optional and not supplied when the function is called, its value is assumed to be nil.
