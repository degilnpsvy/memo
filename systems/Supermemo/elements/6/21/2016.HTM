the built-in Emacs function save-excursion, which is a way of being polite. The function is going to move the cursor around the buffer, so we don't want to disorient the user by jumping them to a strange place in their file just because they asked for a word count. Calling <FONT class=clozed>save-excursion</FONT> tells Emacs to remember the location of cursor at the beginning of the function, and go back there after executing any statements in its body. Notice how save-excursion is providing us with capability similar to let; you can think of it as a way of making the cursor location itself a local variable.</SPAN>
