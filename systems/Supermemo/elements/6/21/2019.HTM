(while condition statement-block) </P>
<P>Like let and save-excursion, while sets up another statement block. condition is a value (an atom, a variable, or a function returning a value). This value is tested; if it is nil, the condition is considered to be false, and the while loop terminates. If the value is other than nil, the condition is considered to be true, the statement block gets executed, the condition is tested again, and the process repeats. Of course, it is possible to write an infinite loop. If you write a Lisp function with a while loop and try running it, and your Emacs session hangs, chances are that you have made this all-too-common mistake; just type C-g to abort it.
