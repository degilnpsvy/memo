defun
<P></P>
<P>The defun defines the function&nbsp;by its name and arguments. Notice that defun is itself a function&#8212;one that, when called, defines a new function. (defun returns the name of the function defined, as a symbol.) The function's arguments appear as a list of names inside parentheses. Arguments can be made optional by preceding them with the keyword &amp;optional. If an argument is optional and not supplied when the function is called, its value is assumed to be nil.
