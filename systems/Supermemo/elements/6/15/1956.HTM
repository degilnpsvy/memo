<P class=docText>A few other commands create blank rectangles. For example, let's say we want to put four more spaces between the cell phone and hours columns. To do this, we set the mark, move to the bottom of the column, move forward four spaces, then type <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>r</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>o</SPAN></FONT> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>open-rectangle</SPAN>). This command inserts a blank rectangle and pushes the remaining text to the right.
