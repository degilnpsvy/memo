<P class=docText>If you're doing some really fancy table editing, being able to store several rectangles is helpful. That way, you can have every column as a rectangle, as well as having a rectangle for the exact amount of blank space to put between each column. You can store rectangles in registers by typing <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x r r</SPAN> <TT><I>r</I></TT></FONT> where <TT><I>r</I></TT> is any alphanumeric character, including punctuation. To insert a rectangle you've stored, type <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x r i</SPAN> <TT><I>r</I></TT></FONT>. Registers don't persist between sessions.
