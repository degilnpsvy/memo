<P class=docText>To define a rectangle, move the cursor to the upper-left corner and set the mark by pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-Space</SPAN>, then move the cursor to the lower-right corner of the rectangle. Once you're at the lower-right corner of the rectangle, move one character farther. Why move one character farther? Remember that when you define a region, the character that the cursor is on <SPAN class=docEmphasis>isn't</SPAN> part of the region. (The character that the mark is on <SPAN class=docEmphasis>is</SPAN> part of the region.)
