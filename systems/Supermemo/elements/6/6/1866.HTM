<P class=docText>To rename a file with Dired (similar to the Unix <SPAN class=docEmphBold>mv</SPAN> command), type <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>R</FONT></SPAN> next to the filename. Emacs asks what the new name should be. Type it and press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>. Emacs says, <TT>Moved: 1 file</TT>.
