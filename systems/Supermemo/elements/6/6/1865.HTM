To copy a file in Dired, type <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C</SPAN> next to it (it must be a capital C)</FONT> . Emacs asks for the name of the file you want to copy to. Type the name and press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>. Emacs says, <TT>Copied: 1 file</TT>. To copy several files in the list, <FONT class=clozed>preface the C with a number. For example, typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>3C</SPAN> would copy this file and the next two files</FONT>.
