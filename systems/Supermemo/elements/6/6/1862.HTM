<P class=docText>Because Emacs generates <A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2175></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2176></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2177></A>backup files and, at times, auto-save files, you may want to delete them from time to time. Emacs offers shortcut commands to flag such files. <FONT class=extract>Typing <TT><B>#</B></TT> flags all the auto-save files (files whose names start and end with <TT><B>#</B></TT>) for deletion.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Emacs flags them with D. Typing <TT><B>~</B></TT> flags all the backup files (whose names end with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>~</SPAN>) for deletion.</FONT> You can remove the flags from backup files you want to keep, for example, the backup copies of files you've recently worked on.
