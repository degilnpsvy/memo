If you move files between platforms, you can wind up with some filenames in uppercase and some in lowercase. Files moving from older versions of Windows may be in all caps, for example. Simply mark the files in question by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>m</SPAN>, then press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>%l</SPAN> for lowercase or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>%u</SPAN> for uppercase.
