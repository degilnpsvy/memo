<P class=docText>Usually you want to work in larger increments than one line or one column at a time, however. When you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>C-u</FONT></SPAN> preceding any of these commands, the command works in increments of four lines or columns at a time. For example, with two horizontal windows on the screen, let's use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u C-x ^</SPAN> to enlarge the <TT>james</TT> window.
