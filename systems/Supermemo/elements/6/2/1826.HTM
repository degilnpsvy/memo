To make windows smaller, you can shrink them. To shrink a window vertically, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>M-x shrink-window</FONT></SPAN>. Emacs shrinks the current window by one line and the other windows on the screen grow accordingly. To shrink a window horizontally, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x {</SPAN>. This command makes the window one column narrower and enlarges the other windows on the screen horizontally
