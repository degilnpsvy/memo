The stack and heap are significant as areas of the system&#8217;s address space, but it&#8217;s important to understand that they&#8217;re <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>to the assembler or linker in the same way as, for example, the .text or .data sections. Typically, the stack and the heap are initialized and maintained by the runtime system. The stack is defined by setting the sp register to the top of available memory (aligned to an eight-byte boundary). The heap is defined by a global pointer variable used by functions such as malloc() functions; it&#8217;s often initialized to the end symbol, which the linker has calculated as the highest location used by declared variables.
