The stack and heap are significant as areas of the system&#8217;s address space, but it&#8217;s important to understand that they&#8217;re <FONT class=clozed>not known </FONT>to the assembler or linker in the same way as, for example, the .text or .data sections. Typically, the stack and the heap are initialized and maintained by <FONT class=clozed>the runtime system</FONT>. The stack is defined by setting the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> register to the top of available memory (aligned to an eight-byte boundary). The heap is defined by a global pointer variable used by functions such as malloc() functions; it&#8217;s often initialized to the end symbol, which the linker has calculated as the highest location used by declared variables.
