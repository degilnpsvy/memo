Vectored interrupts (whether with traditional or EIC signaling) are likely to be most helpful in circumstances where one or two interrupt events in your system are particularly frequent or time-critical. The small number of cycles saved are likely to be lost in fitting into the interrupt-handling discipline of a more sophisticated OS, so don&#8217;t be surprised to find that your favorite OS does not use these features.
