In EIC mode, those six formerly independent signals become a 6-bit binary number: Zero means no interrupt, but that leaves 63 distinct interrupt codes. In EIC mode, each nonzero code has its own interrupt entry point, allowing an appropriately designed interrupt controller to dispatch the CPU directly to handle up to 63 events.</SPAN>
