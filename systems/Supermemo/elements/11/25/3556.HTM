If you switch on the vectored interrupt feature, an interrupt exception will start at one of eight addresses according to the interrupt input signal that caused it. </P>
<P>That&#8217;s slightly ambiguous: There&#8217;s nothing to stop two interrupts being active at once, so the hardware uses the highest-numbered interrupt signal, which is both active and enabled. </P>
<P>Vectored interrupts are set up by programming IntCtl(VS), which gives you a few choices as to the spacing between the different entry points (a zero causes all the interrupts to use the same entry point, as was traditional).
