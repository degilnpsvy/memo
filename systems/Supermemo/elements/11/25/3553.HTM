ldxc1, lwxc1, sdxc1, swxc1: <FONT class=clozed>Base register + offset register addressing mode loads and stores. In the instruction ldxc1 fd, i(b), the full address must lie in the same program memory region as is pointed to by the base register b or bad things might happen. If your toolkit will accept syntax like l.d fd,i(b), then use it.</FONT>
