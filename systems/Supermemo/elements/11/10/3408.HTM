Partial-register loads: 
<P></P>
<P>Loads of less-than-register-size chunks of data must decide what to do with the excess bits in the register. For the unsigned instructions, such as lbu, the byte value is loaded into the register and the remaining bits are cleared to zero (we say that the value has been zero-extended). If the byte value represented a signed number, its top bit would tell us if it was negative. In this case, we&#8217;ll translate to the corresponding register-sized representation by filling the remaining bits of the register with copies of the sign bit, using the instruction lb. That&#8217;s called sign-extending.
