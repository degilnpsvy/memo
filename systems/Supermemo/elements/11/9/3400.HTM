<P><FONT class=clozed>Unaligned load/store macros. The double word and word versions are implemented as macro instructions using the special load left/load right instructions; halfword operations are built as byte memory accesses, shifts, and ors.Note that normal delay slot rules do not apply between the constituent load left/load right of an unaligned operation; the pipeline is designed to let them run head to tail. More on unaligned loads and how they&#8217;re used in section 2.5.2.</FONT>
