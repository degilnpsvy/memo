CPUs built with the simple five-stage pipeline described in Chapter 1 don&#8217;t have much trouble with branches; the branch delay slot instruction is usually executed, and the CPU then moves straight to the branch target. With these simple CPUs, most branches are free (provided the branch delay slot contains a useful instruction) and the others cost only one clock cycle.
