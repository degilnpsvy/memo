<P>Load doubleword (64 bits). This machine instruction is available only on 64-bit CPUs, but assemblers for 32-bit targets will often implement it as a macro instruction that loads 64 bits from memory into two consecutive integer registers. This is probably a really bad idea, but someone wanted some compatibility.
