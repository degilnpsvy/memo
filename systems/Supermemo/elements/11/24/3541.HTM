You don&#8217;t get a multiply unit answer out in one clock: multiply takes 4&#8211;12 clock cycles and division 20&#8211;80 clock cycles (it depends on the implementation, and for some implementations it depends on the size of the operands). <FONT class=extract>Some CPUs have fully or partially pipelined multiply units&#8212;that is, they can start a multiply operation every one or two clocks, even though the result will not arrive for four or five clocks.</FONT>
