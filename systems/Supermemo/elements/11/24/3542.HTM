MIPS32/64 includes a three-operand mul instruction, which returns the low half of the multiply result to a general-purpose register. But that instruction must stall until the operation is finished; <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>will still use separate instructions to start the multiply and retrieve the results. MIPS32/64CPUs (and most other CPUs still on the market) also have multiply-accumulate operations, where products from successive multiply operations are accumulated inside the lo/hi pair.
