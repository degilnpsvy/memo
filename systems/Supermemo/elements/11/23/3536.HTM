Load/stores must be aligned: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Memory operations can only load or store data from addresses aligned to suit the data type being transferred.</FONT> Bytes can be transferred at any address, but halfwords must be even-aligned and word transfers aligned to four-byte boundaries. Many CISC microprocessors will load/store a four-byte item from any byte address, but the penalty is extra clock cycles. However, the MIPS instruction set architecture (ISA) does include a couple of peculiar instructions to simplify the job of loading or storing at improperly aligned addresses.
