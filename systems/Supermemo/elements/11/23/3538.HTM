a MIPS CPU has a special-purpose integer multiply unit, which is not quite integrated with the main pipeline. The multiply unit&#8217;s basic operation is to multiply two register-sized values together to produce a twice-registersized result, which is stored inside the multiply unit. The instructions mfhi, mflo retrieve the result in two halves into specified general registers.
