Byte-addressed: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Once data is in a register of a MIPS CPU, all operations always work on the whole register. But the semantics of languages such as C fit badly on a machine that can&#8217;t address memory locations down to byte granularity, so MIPS gets a complete set of load/store operations for 8- and 16-bit variables (we will say byte and halfword). Once the data has arrived in a register it will be treated as data of full register length, so partial-word load instructions come in two flavors&#8212;sign-extend and zero-extend.</FONT>
