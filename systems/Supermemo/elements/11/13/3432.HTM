dmul, mul: Three-operand 64-/32-bit multiply instruction. There is no overflow check; as a result, there doesn&#8217;t need to be an unsigned version of the macro&#8212;the truncated result is the same for signed and unsigned interpretation. Assemblers will expand it into an equivalent macro if they know they are assembling for pre-MIPS32 CPUs that don&#8217;t implement it.
