But the assembler found in most toolchains is likely to leave this to the compiler. By a less-than-obvious convention, a multiply or divide written with the destination register zero (as in div zero,s,t) will give you the raw machine instruction.&#65288;Some toolkits interpret special mnemonics, mult for multiplication and divd for division, for the machine instructions. However, specifying zero as the destination, though bizarre, is more portable.&#65289;It is then up to you to fetch the result from hi and/or lo and to do any checking you need.
