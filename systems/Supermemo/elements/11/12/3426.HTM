However, when you write the usual assembly mnemonics for multiply/divide, the assembler will generate a sequence of instructions that simulate a three-operand instruction and perform overflow checking. A div (signed divide) may expand into as many as 13 instructions. The extra instructions are usually placed <FONT class=clozed>between</FONT> the div, which starts the divide, and the mflo, which retrieves the result. The extra instructions look inefficient, but they run in parallel with the hardware divider; the divide itself takes 7&#8211;75 cycles on most MIPS CPUs.
