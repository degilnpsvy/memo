As a result of being handled by a separate unit, <FONT class=extract>multiply/divide instructions don&#8217;t include overflow or divide-by-zero tests (they can&#8217;t cause exceptions because they are running asynchronously)</FONT> and don&#8217;t usually deliver their results into general-purpose registers (it would complicate the pipeline by fighting a later instruction for the ability to write the register file). Instead,<FONT class=extract>multiply/divide results appear in the two separate registers hi and lo. You can only access these values with the two special instructions mfhi and mflo.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Even in the earliest MIPS CPUs, the result registers are interlocked: If you try to read the result before it is ready, the CPU will stall until the data arrives.</FONT>
