2.7.2 Who Needs 64 Bits? </P>
<P>By 1996, 32 bits was no longer a big enough address space for the very largest workstation and server applications. Pundits seem to agree that programs grow bigger exponentially, doubling every 18 months or so. So long as this goes on, demand for address space is expanding at about 3/4 of a bit per year. Genuine 32-bit CPUs (68020, i386) appeared to replace 16/20-bit machines somewhere around 1984&#8212;and indeed, 32 bits really began to look inadequate around 2002. If this makes MIPS&#8217;s 1991 move seem premature, that&#8217;s probably true&#8212;big MIPS proponent Silicon Graphics did not introduce its first 64-bit-capable OS into general use until 1995. </P>
<P>MIPS&#8217;s early move was spurred by research interest in operating systems using large sparse virtual address spaces, which permit objects to be named by their virtual address over a long period of time. MIPS was by no means the most prestigious organization to be deceived about the rate at which operating systems would evolve; Intel&#8217;s world-dominating 32-bit CPU range had to wait 11 years before Windows 95 brought 32-bit operation to the mass market.</P>
<P>A side effect of the 64-bit architecture is that such a computer can handle more bits at once, which can speed up some data-intensive applications in graphics and imaging. It&#8217;s not clear, though, whether this is really preferable to the multimedia instruction set extensions exemplified by Intel&#8217;s MMX, which features wide data paths with a new set of wide registers, and some way of operating simultaneously on multiple one-byte or 16-bit chunks of that wide data.</P>
<P>MIPS&#8217;s DSP ASE is somewhat similar&#8212;see section B.2. By 1996, any architecture with pretensions to longevity needed a 64-bit implementation. Maybe getting there early was not a bad thing.</P>
<P>The nature of the MIPS architecture&#8212;committed to a flat address space and the use of general-purpose registers as pointers&#8212;means that 64-bit addressing and 64-bit registers go together. Even where the long addresses are irrelevant, the increased bandwidth of the wide registers and ALU may be useful for routines that shovel a lot of data, which are often found in graphics or high-speed communication applications.</P>
<P>It&#8217;s one of the signs of hope for the MIPS architecture (and certain other simpler RISC architectures) that the move to 64 bits makes segmentation (which still burden even 64-bit versions of x86 and PowerPC architectures) totally pointless.
