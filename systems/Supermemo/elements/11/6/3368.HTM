But mode switches are kludges and in any case are difficult to implement in a machine that is not microcoded. MIPS64 uses a different approach: <FONT class=clozed>All instructions from the 32-bit architecture are preserved. So long as you only run MIPS32 instructions you get 100 percent compatibility:</FONT></SPAN>
