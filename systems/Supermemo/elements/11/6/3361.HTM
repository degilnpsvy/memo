We did the fill operation because some CPUs may detect and trap on parity errors, even on apparently invalid cache lines. Unfortunately the Fill I operation is not mandated by MIPS32/64. You can reasonably expect that any CPU that implements parity or ECC protection will include it: CPUs that don&#8217;t protect cache data need only the first store tag loop.</FONT>
