But cache miss rates are affected by many factors, some of them rather unexpected. For example, x86 CPUs are rather short of registers, so a program compiled for x86 will generate many more data load and store events than the same program compiled for MIPS. But the extra loads and stores will be of the stack locations that the x86 compiler uses as surrogates for registers; this is a very heavily used area of memory and will be very effectively cached. The number of misses per thousand instructions is not so affected by this kind of difference.</SPAN></SPAN>
