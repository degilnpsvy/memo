A semaphore(12. A simple semaphore is also called a mutex and informally just called a &#8220;lock.&#8221; ) is a coding convention to implement critical regions (though extended semaphores can do more tricks than that). The semaphore is a shared memory location used by concurrently running processes to arrange that some resource is only accessed by one of them at once.
