Load/store double (64-bit format) and single (32-bit format). Alignment is required, and no unaligned versions are given here. On 32-bit CPUs, l.d and s.d are two-instruction macros that load/store two 32-bit chunks of memory into/from consecutive FP registers (see section 7.5).These instructions are also called ldc1, lwc1, sdc1, and swc1 (load/store word/double to coprocessor 1), but don&#8217;t write them like that.
