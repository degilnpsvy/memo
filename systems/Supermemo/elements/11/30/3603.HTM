<FONT class=extract>In most arithmetic operations, U denotes &#8220;no overflow test.&#8221;</FONT> Unsuffixed arithmetic operations like add cause a CPU exception if the result overflows into bit 31 (the sign bit when we&#8217;re thinking of integers as signed). The suffixed variant addu produces exactly the same result for all combinations of operands but never takes an exception.C and C++ do not support integer overflow exceptions and always use the &#8220;u&#8221; form&#8212;it has nothing to do with whether a variable is signed or unsigned. You should always use addu and so on unless you really know why not.
