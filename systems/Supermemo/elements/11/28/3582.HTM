Many MIPS CPUs use the program (virtual) address to provide a fast index for their L1 caches. But rather than using the program address plus an address space identifier to tag the cache line, they use the physical address. The physical address is unique to the cache line and is efficient because <FONT class=clozed>the scheme allows the CPU to translate program addresses to physical addresses at the same time as it is looking up the cache</FONT>.</SPAN>
