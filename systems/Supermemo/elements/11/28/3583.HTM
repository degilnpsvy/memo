There&#8217;s another, more subtle problem with program addresses, which the physical tag does not solve: The same physical location may be described by different addresses in different tasks. In turn, that might lead to the same memory location being cached in two different cache entries (because they were referred to by different virtual addresses that selected different cache indexes). Many MIPS CPUs do not have hardware to detect or avoid these cache aliases and leave them as a problem to be worked around by the OS&#8217;s memory manager; see section 4.12 for details.
