Only three things are guaranteed in SR: The CPU is in kernel mode; interrupts are disabled; and exceptions will vector through the uncached entry points&#8212;that is, SR(BEV) = 1. In modern CPUs, the first two conditions (and more beside) are typically guaranteed by setting the exception-mode bit SR(EXL), and this is implied by treating reset as an exception.</FONT>
