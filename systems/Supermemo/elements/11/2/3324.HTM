We said that there need to be two instructions, because there are two bus cycles. </P>
<P>The 32-bit instructions are lwl and lwr, for &#8220;load word left&#8221; and &#8220;load word right&#8221;; the 64-bit instructions are ldl and ldr, for &#8220;load double left&#8221; and &#8220;load double right.&#8221;</P>
<P>The &#8220;left&#8221; instruction deals with the high-order bits of the unaligned integer, and the &#8220;right&#8221; instruction fetches the low-order bits (&#8220;left&#8221; is used in the same sense as in &#8220;shift-left&#8221;). Because the instructions are defined in terms of more significant and less significant bits, but must deal with a byte-addressed memory, their detailed use depends on the endianness of the CPU (see section 10.2). A big-endian CPU keeps more significant bits earlier, in lower byte addresses, and a little-endian CPU keeps more significant bits later, in higher addresses.
