It&#8217;s almost universal practice (though not compulsory) to pass assembly source files as written by a human programmer through <FONT class=clozed>the C preprocessor </FONT>before handing them to the assembler itself. Used appropriately, this can make for much more readable source files, in which items such as machine registers are referenced by names that convey meaning to the human programmer; the task of converting these names to the less readable forms required by the assembler itself is best left to the toolchain.
