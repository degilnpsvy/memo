Many programmers find it helpful to follow a simple convention: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>an assembly source file that&#8217;s fed to the preprocessor as input is given a name suffixed with &#8220;.S,&#8221;</FONT> and <FONT class=extract>the reprocessed version generated as output is given the same name suffixed with &#8220;.s&#8221;;</FONT> this makes it easier to manage the two forms of assembly source files.
