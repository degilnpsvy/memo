It&#8217;s commonplace for one instruction to use a result obtained by its immediate predecessor. In a pipelined processor you&#8217;d normally read the second instruction&#8217;s operand from the register file before its predecessor&#8217;s value had been written back. That&#8217;s not a problem, <FONT class=clozed>because MIPS instructions only pass data in registers, and data going to and from the general-purpose and floating-point registers is extensively bypassed&#8212;that is, the hardware detects the dependency and arranges to forward the data directly to the second instruction, just as it needs it.</FONT>
