<P><FONT class=clozed><FONT class=extract>The most obvious is where the dependent instruction uses the value provided by the first: That&#8217;s called an exception hazard.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>But a more troublesome case is where the write changes some CPU state so as to affect even the fetch of subsequent instructions: That&#8217;s the case, for example, with a CP0 write that changes the memory translation setup. Those are called instruction hazards.</FONT></FONT>
