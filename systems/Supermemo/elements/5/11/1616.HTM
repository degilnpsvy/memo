If your file has page breaks in it, you can move to the next page or previous page by typing C-x ] (forward-page) or C-x [ (backward-page). Similar to paragraph and sentence movement, moving by page involves the Emacs definition of what a page is. A variable called page-delimiter defines what constitutes a page break. If there are no Emacs-recognized page breaks in the file, Emacs regards the buffer as one very long page. In this case, the forward-page command takes you to the end of the buffer, and the backward-page command takes you to the beginning of the buffer.

<P>In text mode, a page break is a formfeed character that tells the printer to move to the next page (to feed the next form or page through the printer, hence the term formfeed) before continuing to print. <FONT class=extract>If you are in text mode and you want to insert page breaks in your file, type C-q C-l (the lowercase letter L).</FONT> C-q is the quoted-insert command. It tells Emacs to put a C-l control character in your file, rather than interpreting C-l as the recenter command. A C-l character looks like two characters (^L), but it's really only one. (Try to erase one using Del and see what we mean.)<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: &#23435;&#20307;; mso-font-kerning: 0pt"></SPAN>
