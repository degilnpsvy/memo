<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'"><FONT size=5>There's one caveat about moving </FONT><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1681></A><FONT size=5>by sentence or paragraph. Emacs defines a sentence pretty strictly. You need <SPAN class=docemphasis>two</SPAN> spaces after the final punctuation mark, unless you're at the end of the line. If there's only one space, Emacs won't recognize it. Similarly, moving backward and forward by paragraph involves understanding the Emacs definition of a paragraph. To Emacs (and to most of us), paragraphs are either indented with a tab or at least one space or have blank lines between them (block style).</FONT></SPAN>
