Conveniently, if you kill several lines in succession, Emacs collects them into a single item and places the whole unit into the kill ring; a single C-y command will bring everything back. In the following example, we'll use C-k four times to delete the first two lines of A Tale of Two Cities. (Remember: the first C-k deletes the text; the second C-k deletes the remaining blank line.) Then we'll use a single C-y to bring everything back.</FONT></SPAN></P>

Everything you delete with C-k in addition to everything you delete with C-w and everything you copy with M-w (two commands that you'll learn shortly) go into the kill ring. Words, sentences, and paragraphs that you delete with M-d, M-Del, and their relatives also go into the kill ring. In addition, text that you delete with C-u followed by either Del or C-d goes into the kill ring. About the only thing that Emacs doesn't save in the kill ring is single characters, deleted with Del or C-d. (If you need to, you can get this type of deletion back using the undo command, bound to both C- _ and C-x u.)</FONT></SPAN></P>

Emacs stops assembling these blocks of text as soon as you give any command that isn't a kill command. For example, if you type C-k, then delete a single character with C-d, then type another C-k, you've broken the chain. Emacs doesn't consider deletion of a single character with C-d a "kill" command; it's just a deletion and it isn't stored. In this case, you haven't made a single chain of kill commands; you've made two chains. Later, we'll see how to get the older killed text back.</FONT></SPAN>
