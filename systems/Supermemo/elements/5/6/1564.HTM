If the region is not highlighted, you'll want to make sure it is marked correctly before giving the delete command. <FONT class=extract>Press <SPAN class=docemphbold>C-x C-x</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docemphbold>exchange-point-and-mark</SPAN>); this command swaps the locations of the mark and the point.</FONT> If the cursor moves to where you thought the mark was, the region is marked correctly. Especially because you can't see the mark, it's a good habit to check its location using <SPAN class=docemphbold>C-x C-x</SPAN> before deleting a region. People who have used Emacs for years still forget to set the mark and then make a deletion without knowing what they've just deleted. (The undo command, bound to <SPAN class=docemphbold>C-_</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docemphbold>C-x u</SPAN>, comes in handy in such a case.)</FONT></SPAN>
