A few shortcuts are helpful in some of the most common situations. <FONT class=extract>To mark a paragraph, press M-h. This sets the mark at the end of the paragraph and places the cursor at the beginning automatically.</FONT> Similarly, <FONT class=extract>C-x h (for mark-whole-buffer) marks the entire buffer; the cursor goes to the beginning, and the mark is placed at the end.</FONT> Finally, <FONT class=extract>C-x C-p marks the current page, with pages being defined by the C-l character if you are in text mode.</FONT> Of course, marking a paragraph, page, or buffer is usually only the prelude to some other operation, like killing (C-w).
