If you want to create a <A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-1998></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-1999></A>buffer that contains a file, simply type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-f</SPAN> to find the file. Emacs automatically creates a second buffer and moves you there. If you already have a copy of the file in a buffer, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-f</SPAN> just moves you to the existing buffer.
