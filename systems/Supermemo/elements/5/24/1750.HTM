To skip this occurrence of a misspelled word, press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Space</SPAN>. To ignore a misspelled word for the rest of the session for all buffers, press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>a</SPAN> (for accept). Uppercase <SPAN class=docEmphBold>A</SPAN> has one subtle difference: it tells Ispell to accept the word for this session but only in this buffer.
