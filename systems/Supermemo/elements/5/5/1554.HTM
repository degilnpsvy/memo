<P class=docText><FONT class=extract><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-l</SPAN>, the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>recenter</SPAN> command, puts </FONT><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1691></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1692></A><FONT class=extract>the current line in the center of the window vertically.</FONT> This feature is useful if you're typing at the bottom or the top of the display. Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-l</SPAN> quickly moves the material that you care about to the middle of the display, where it is easier to see the full context.</P>
<P class=docText><FONT class=extract><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-l</SPAN> also redraws the display, if for any reason it appears obscured or contains random characters.</FONT> This doesn't happen as often as it used to when we used terminals, but it can be a handy thing to know about, especially if you find yourself using Emacs remotely in a terminal interface.
