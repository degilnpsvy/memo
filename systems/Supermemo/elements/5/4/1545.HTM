<P class=docText>There are two more ways to move around that may come in handy. <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> moves the cursor to line <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> of the file. Of course, Emacs starts counting lines from the beginning of the file. Likewise, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x goto-char Enter</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN> goes to the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>th character of the file, counting from the beginning. In both cases, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> is a number.
