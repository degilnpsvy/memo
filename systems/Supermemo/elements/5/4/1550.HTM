<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>You can give <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-</SPAN><SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> a large argument if you want it to repeat the command many times.</FONT> For example, let's say you are editing a large file of 1000 lines. If you typed <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-500 C-n</SPAN>, the cursor would move down 500 lines, to the halfway point in the file. If you give <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-</SPAN><SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN> a larger argument than it can execute, it repeats the command as many times as possible and then stops.</P>
<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>There's another multiplier command you can use, too: <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN> (the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>universal-argument</SPAN> command). You can give <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN> an argument just like you do <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-</SPAN><SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>. Typing either <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-5</SPAN> or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u 5</SPAN> repeats the command that follows five times. But unlike <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-</SPAN><SPAN class=docEmphasis>n</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN> doesn't need an argument to repeat commands. With no argument, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN> executes the next command four times. If you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u C-u</SPAN>, it executes the command 16 times. In this way, you can stack up <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN>'s to make commands execute many times: 16, 64, 256, and so on.<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-2-sect-1.html#gnu3-chp-2-fnote-2">[2]</A></SUP></FONT>
