Earlier we mentioned the kill ring, a temporary storage area in which Emacs saves the stuff you delete. So far, we've assumed that you're interested in resurrecting what you've most recently killed. However, the kill ring does a lot more. It actually stores your last 30 deletions. We've seen that <FONT class=extract>C-y restores the text you deleted most recently. Typing M-y deletes the text you just yanked and gets the next most recent text from the kill ring.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>You can keep on typing M-y, retrieving successively more ancient deletions, until you reach the end of the kill ring (at which point it cycles back to the most recently killed text; that's why it's called a ring).</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Thirty deletions by default is a nice size&#8212;far more generous than most programs offer. But you can enlarge or reduce the size of the kill ring if you wish, using a variable called kill-ring-max. To experiment, give the command: M-x set-variable Enter kill-ring-max Enter new-value Enter (where new-value is a number).</FONT>
