Instead, Emacs copies the contents of a file into a temporary buffer and you edit that. The file on disk doesn't change until you save the buffer.</FONT> 
<P class=docText>Like files, Emacs buffers have names. The name of a buffer is usually the same as the name of the file that you're editing. There are a few exceptions. Some buffers don't have associated files&#8212;for example, <TT>*scratch*</TT> is just a temporary practice buffer, like a scratchpad; the help facility displays help messages in a buffer named <TT>*Help*</TT>, which also isn't connected to a file.
