In a precise exception CPU, on any exception we are pointed at one instruction (the exception victim). All instructions preceding the exception victim in execution sequence are complete; but <FONT class=clozed>it&#8217;s as if the exception victim and any successors were never started.( This is not quite the same as saying that the exception victim and subsequent instructions haven&#8217;t done anything. But it does require that, when re-executed after the exception, those instructions will behave exactly as they would have done if the exception hadn&#8217;t happened.</FONT>
