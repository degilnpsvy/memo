For example, if you wanted to edit <SPAN class=docEmphasis>dickens</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>joyce</SPAN>, you would type <FONT class=clozed><SPAN class=docEmphBold>emacs dickens joyce</SPAN> </FONT>and Emacs would display these files in two horizontal windows. If you try this with more than two files, Emacs displays two horizontal windows, with a file in one and a list of buffers in the other.
