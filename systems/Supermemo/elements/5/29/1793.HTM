<H3 class=docSection1Title>4.3. Working with Windows</H3>
<P class=docText>Windows are areas on the screen in <A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2009></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2010></A>which Emacs displays the buffers that you are editing. You can have multiple windows on the screen at one time, each displaying a different buffer or different parts of the same buffer. Granted, the more windows you have, the smaller each one is; unlike GUI windows, Emacs windows can't overlap, so as you add more windows, the older ones shrink. The screen is like a pie; you can cut it into many pieces, but the more pieces you cut, the smaller they have to be. You can place windows side-by-side, one on top of the other, or mix them. Each window has its own mode line that identifies the buffer name, the modes you're running, and your position in the buffer. To make it clear where one window begins and another ends, mode lines are usually shaded.</P>
<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>As we've said, windows are not buffers. In fact, you can have more than one window on the same buffer. Doing so is often helpful if you want to look at different parts of a large file simultaneously. You can even have the same part of the buffer displayed in two windows, and any change you make in one window is reflected in the other.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>The difference between buffers and windows becomes important when you think about marking, cutting, and pasting text. Marks are associated with buffers, not with windows, and each buffer can have only </FONT><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2011></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2012></A><FONT class=extract>one mark. If you go to another window on the same buffer and set the mark, Emacs moves the mark to the new location, forgetting the place you set it last.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText>As for cursors, you have only <A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2013></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2014></A>one cursor, and the cursor's location determines the active window. However, although there is only one cursor at a time, each window does keep track of your current editing location separately&#8212;that is, you can move the cursor from one window to another, do some editing, jump back to the first window, and be in the same place. A window's notion of your current position (whether or not the cursor is in the window) is called the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>point</SPAN>. Each window has its own point. It's easy to use the terms <SPAN class=docEmphasis>point</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cursor</SPAN> interchangeably&#8212;but we'll try to be specific.</P>
<P class=docText>You can create horizontal windows or vertical windows or both, but personally we place vertical windows with the more advanced esoterica near the end of the chapter. Here we'll discuss creating horizontal windows, finding a file in a new window, and deleting windows.</P><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-SECT-3.1></A>

This command splits the current window into two, horizontally oriented windows. You can repeat this command to split the screen into more horizontal windows.</FONT></P><A name=ch04-6-fm2xml></A>

<P class=docText>You can also have Emacs <A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2019></A>set up <A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2020></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2021></A>windows for you when you start a session. If you want to edit two files in horizontal windows, specify their filenames when you start Emacs at a command prompt. <FONT class=extract>For example, if you wanted to edit <SPAN class=docEmphasis>dickens</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>joyce</SPAN>, you would type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>emacs dickens joyce</SPAN> and Emacs would display these files in two horizontal windows. If you try this with more than two files, Emacs displays two horizontal windows, with a file in one and a list of buffers in the other.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>A number of the "other window" commands are just the ordinary command with a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>4</SPAN> inserted in it. For example, to find a file in another window, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x 4 f</SPAN>. (If only one window is currently open, Emacs opens another one.) To select a different buffer in another window, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x 4 b</SPAN>. Many users find these commands preferable to the normal <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-f</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x b</SPAN> commands because they save you a step: you need not move to the window, give a command, and move back.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>Once you've got multiple windows open, it's helpful to be able to scroll them without moving there. To scroll the other window, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-M-v</SPAN>.</FONT></P><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-SECT-3.2></A>
