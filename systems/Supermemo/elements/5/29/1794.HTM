<P class=docText>As we've said, windows are not buffers. In fact, you can have more than one window on the same buffer. Doing so is often helpful if you want to look at different parts of a large file simultaneously. You can even have the same part of the buffer displayed in two windows, and any change you make in one window is reflected in the other.</P>
<P class=docText>The difference between buffers and windows becomes important when you think about marking, cutting, and pasting text. <FONT class=extract>Marks are associated with buffers, not with windows, and each buffer can have only </FONT><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2011></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-4-ITERM-2012></A><FONT class=extract>one mark.</FONT> If you go to another window on the same buffer and set the mark, Emacs moves the mark to the new location, forgetting the place you set it last.
