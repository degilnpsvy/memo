<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>A number of the "other window" commands are just the ordinary command with a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>4</SPAN> inserted in it.</FONT> For example, <FONT class=extract>to find a file in another window, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x 4 f</SPAN>. (If only one window is currently open, Emacs opens another one.)</FONT> <FONT class=extract>To select a different buffer in another window, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x 4 b</SPAN>. Many users find these commands preferable to the normal <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-f</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x b</SPAN> commands because they save you a step: you need not move to the window, give a command, and move back.</FONT>
