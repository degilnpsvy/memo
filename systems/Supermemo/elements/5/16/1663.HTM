Emacs doesn't provide any special commands for restoring a buffer from the backup copy. The easiest way to do this is to edit the backup copy and then save it as the real file. For example, if you were working with a file called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>text</SPAN>, you could: exit Emacs by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-c</SPAN>, then start Emacs again by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>emacs</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphasis>text~</SPAN>. After the backup file is displayed, save it as the real file by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-w</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphasis>text</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>.
