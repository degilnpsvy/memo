Most of the time you'll respond to the prompt by pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Space</SPAN>, telling Emacs to perform the replacement and go on to the next instance, or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>n</SPAN> to skip this replacement and go on to the next instance. If you're not too sure what will happen, enter a comma (,); Emacs makes the replacement but doesn't go on until you press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Space</SPAN>. After performing the first few replaces, you may realize that there's no need to inspect every change individually. Typing an exclamation mark (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>!</SPAN>) tells Emacs to go ahead and finish the job without bothering you anymore. If you remember these keystrokes, you're all set.
