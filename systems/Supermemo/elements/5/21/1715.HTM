When doing replacements, Emacs pays attention to the form of the word being replaced and replaces it with <FONT class=clozed>the same case</FONT>. If you replaced <SPAN class=docEmphasis>random</SPAN> with <SPAN class=docEmphasis>tandem</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Random</SPAN> would be replaced with <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Tandem</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>RANDOM</SPAN> would be replaced with <SPAN class=docEmphasis>TANDEM</SPAN>.
