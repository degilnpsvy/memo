<P class=docText>Likewise, if you don't want Emacs to <A name=gnu3-CHP-3-ITERM-1914></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-3-ITERM-1915></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-3-ITERM-1916></A>adjust the case of your replacement strings, you can set the variable <SPAN class=docEmphBold>case-replace</SPAN>. Again, its value is <SPAN class=docEmphBold>t</SPAN> (for "true") by default, which means "adjust the case of a replacement string to match the original text"&#8212;that is, capitalize the replacement if the original word was capitalized and so on. Setting this variable to <SPAN class=docEmphBold>nil</SPAN> means "never adjust the case of the replacement string; always put it in exactly as I typed it." To change the value of <SPAN class=docEmphBold>case-replace</SPAN>, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>set-variable</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter case-replace Enter nil Enter</SPAN> (there's no menu option for this variable).
