<P class=docText>If you notice that the word you just typed is incorrect, <FONT class=extract>you can use the same commands prefaced by <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Meta-</SPAN> (press and hold <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Meta</SPAN> followed by a hyphen). This corrects the previous word without moving the cursor.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>If the cursor is positioned in the middle of a word, using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Meta-</SPAN> before a command causes it to work on the first part of the word (the part preceding the cursor), rather than the part following the cursor.</FONT>
