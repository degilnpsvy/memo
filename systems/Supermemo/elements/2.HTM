When an element comes up for a repetition, you should make a quick and nearly instinctive assessment of the following: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>1.Do I really need this element? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>2.Do I really need to know it now? Or can I learn it later? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>3.Is this element difficult to remember? If so, why? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>4.Is it factually correct? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>5.Is it as simple and clear as possible?</FONT>
