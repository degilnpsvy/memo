<P></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">Linker scripts are text files. You write a linker script as a series of commands. Each command is either a keyword, possibly followed by arguments or an assignment to a symbol. You may separate commands using semicolons. Whitespace is generally ignored. Strings such as file or format names can normally be entered directly. If the file name contains a character such as a comma, which would otherwise serve to separate file names, you may put the file name in double quotes. There is no way to use a double quote character in a file name. You may include comments in linker scripts just as in C, delimited by </SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Courier">/* </SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">and </SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; FONT-FAMILY: Courier; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Courier">*/</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">. As in C, comments are syntactically equivalent to whitespace.</SPAN>
