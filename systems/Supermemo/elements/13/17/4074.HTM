G(global):</P>
<P>When the G bit in a TLB entry is set, that TLB entry will match solely on the VPN field, regardless of whether the TLB entry&#8217;s ASID field matches the value in EntryHi. That provides an efficient mechanism to implement parts of the address space that are shared between all processes. Note that there is really only one &#8220;G&#8221; bit in a TLB entry, although there are two EntryLo registers: bad things will happen if you have different values in EntryLo0(G) and EntryLo1(G).
