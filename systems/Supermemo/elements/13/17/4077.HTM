When you compile C or C++ programs, the compiler inserts a call at the beginning of main to a __main support subroutine. To avoid linking to the standard libraries, specify the -nostdlib option (including -lgcc at the end of your compiler command line input resolves this reference, linking only with the compiler support library libgcc.a; ending your command&#8217;s input with it ensures that you get a chance to link first with any of your own special libraries).
