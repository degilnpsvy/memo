C: A 3-bit field originally defined for cache-coherent multiprocessor systems to set the &#8220;cache algorithm&#8221; (or &#8220;cache coherency attribute&#8221;&#8212; some manuals call this field CCA). An OS will typically know that some pages will not need to have changes tracked automatically through multiple caches&#8212;pages known to be used only by one CPU, or known to be read-only, don&#8217;t need so much care. It can make the system more efficient to turn off the cache snooping and interaction for accesses to these pages, and this field is used by the OS to note that the page is, for example, cacheable but doesn&#8217;t need coherency management (&#8220;cacheable noncoherent&#8221;). </P>
<P>But the field has also been used in CPUs aimed at embedded applications, when it selects how the cache works&#8212;for example, marking some particular page to be managed &#8220;write-through&#8221; (that is, all writes made there are sent straight to main memory as well as to any cached copy). The only universally supported values of this field denote &#8220;uncached&#8221; (2) and &#8220;cacheable noncoherent&#8221; (3).
