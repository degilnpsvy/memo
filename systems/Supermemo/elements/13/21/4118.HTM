Note that if the CPU has an MMU, this means that all user addresses must be translated by the MMU before reaching physical memory, giving an OS the power to prevent a user program from running amok. That means, though, that the user privilege level is <FONT class=clozed>redundant</FONT> for a MIPS CPU running without a memory-mapped OS.</SPAN>
