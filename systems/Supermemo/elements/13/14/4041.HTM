The CPU looks at an instruction, updates the state of the system in the appropriate ways, then goes on to the next instruction. But our program can run faster if <FONT class=clozed>we allow the CPU to break out of this purely sequential form of execution, so that operations aren&#8217;t necessarily constrained to take place in strict program order</FONT>. This is particularly true of the read and write transactions performed at the processor&#8217;s interface, triggered by its execution of load and store instructions.
