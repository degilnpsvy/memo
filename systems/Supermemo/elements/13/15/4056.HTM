Have we got FP hardware? </P>
<P>Your MIPS32/64 CPU should tell you through the Config1(FP) register bit. For older CPUs one recommended technique is to set SR(CU1) to enable coprocessor 1 operations and to use a cfc1 instruction from coprocessor 1 register 0, which is defined to hold the revision ID. A nonzero value in the ProcessorID field (bits 8&#8211;15) indicates the presence of FPU hardware&#8212; you&#8217;ll most often see the same value as in the PRId(Imp) field.
