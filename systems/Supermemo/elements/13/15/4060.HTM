CPU clock rate: It is often useful to work out your clock rate. You can do this by running a loop of known length, cached, that will take a fixed large number of CPU cycles and then comparing with &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; values of a counter outside the CPU that increments at known speed. Do make sure that you are really running cached, or you will get strange results&#8212;remember that some hardware can&#8217;t run cached out of ROM.
