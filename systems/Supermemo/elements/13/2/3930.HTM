MIPS CPUs have an instruction, eret, that does the whole job; it both clears the SR(EXL) bit and returns control to the address stored in EPC.&#65288;6. Very early MIPS I CPUs had a more complex scheme relying on a two-level stack to save and restore preexception values of the SR(IE,KU) fields. The switch back to preexception mode was done by an instruction called rfe, which had to be run in the delay slot of the jr that took you back to the interrupted program. &#65289;
