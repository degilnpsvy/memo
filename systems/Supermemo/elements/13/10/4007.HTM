<FONT class=extract>Sophisticated DMA controllers share control/status information with the CPU using small descriptor data structures held in memory.</FONT> Typically, the CPU uses these to create a long list of information to be transferred, and only then tells the DMA controller to begin its work. If your system uses descriptors, you&#8217;ll want to access the memory region that contains them through an uncached address region.
