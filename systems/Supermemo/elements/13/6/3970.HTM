When a DMA device puts data into memory, for example, on receipt of network data, most MIPS systems don&#8217;t update the caches&#8212;even though some cache lines may currently be holding addresses within the region just updated by the DMA transfer. If the CPU subsequently reads the information in those cache lines, it&#8217;ll pick up the old, stale version in the cache; as far as the CPU can tell, that&#8217;s still marked valid, and there&#8217;s no indication that the memory has a newer version.
