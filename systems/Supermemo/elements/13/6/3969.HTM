This isn&#8217;t recommended either, because it&#8217;ll almost certainly degrade your system&#8217;s overall performance far more than you&#8217;d like. Even if your software&#8217;s access to the buffers is purely sequential, caching the DMA buffer regions will mean that information gets read and written in efficient cache-line-sized bursts rather than single transfers.
