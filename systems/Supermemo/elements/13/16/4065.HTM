<FONT class=extract>cpp is a C-compatible macro preprocesso </FONT>, working with the GNU compiler, to direct the parsing of C preprocessor directives. Preprocessing directives are the lines in your program that start with a # directive name (a # sign followed by an identifier). cpp merges #include files, for instance, then expands macro definitions, and processes #ifdef sections; another example is #define, a directive that defines a macro (#define must be followed by a macro name and the macro&#8217;s intended expansion).
