2.8.1 Addressing in Simple Systems </P>
<P>MIPS program addresses are never simply the same as physical addresses, but simple embedded software will probably use addresses in kseg0 and kseg1, where the program address is related in an obvious way to physical addresses. Physical memory locations from 0x2000.0000 (512 MB) upward are not mapped anywhere in that simple picture, and most simple systems map everything below 512 MB. But if you need to, you can reach higher addresses by putting translation entries in the memory management unit (the TLB) or by using some of the extra spaces available in 64-bit CPUs.
