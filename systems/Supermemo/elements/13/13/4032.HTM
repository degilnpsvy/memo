<FONT class=extract>kseg0 0x8000.0000&#8211;9FFF.FFFF (512MB): These addresses are translated into physical addresses by merely stripping off the top bit and mapping them contiguously into the low 512 MB of physical memory. Since this is a trivial translation, these addresses are often called &#8220;untranslated,&#8221;but now you know better!</FONT>

<P>Addresses in this region are almost always accessed through the cache, so they may not be used until the caches are properly initialized. They will be used for most programs and data in systems not using the MMU and will be used for the OS kernel for systems that do use the MMU.
