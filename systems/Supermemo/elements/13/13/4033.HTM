kseg1 0xA000.0000&#8211;BFFF.FFFF (512MB): These addresses are mapped into physical addresses by stripping off the leading 3 bits, giving a duplicate mapping of the low 512 MB of physical memory. But this time, access will not use the cache. 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The kseg1 region is the only chunk of the memory map that is guaranteed to behave properly from system reset</FONT>; that&#8217;s why the after-reset starting point (0xBFC0.0000) lies within it. <FONT class=extract>The physical address of the starting point is 0x1FC0.0000</FONT>&#8212;tell your hardware engineer. (The engineer wouldn&#8217;t be the first to have put the ROM at physical address 0xBFC0.0000 and found that the system wouldn&#8217;t bootstrap.) </P>
<P>You will therefore use this region to access your initial program ROM, and most people use it for I/O registers. If your hardware designer proposes to map such things outside the low 512 MB of physical memory, apply persuasion.
