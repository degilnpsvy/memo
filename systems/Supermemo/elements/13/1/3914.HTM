In Jump instructions, there are 26 bits to define the target of a jump.Since <FONT class=clozed>all instructions are four-byte aligned in memory, the two least significant address bits need not be stored</FONT>, allowing an address range of <FONT class=clozed>2^28 = 256 </FONT>MB. Rather than make this branch PC <FONT class=clozed>relative</FONT>, this is interpreted as an <FONT class=clozed>absolute address within a 256-MB segment.</FONT>
