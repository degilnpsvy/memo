There&#8217;s more about the hardware origin of cache aliases in section 4.12. The problem occurs with L1 caches that are <FONT class=clozed>virtually indexed but physically tagged, and where the index range is big enough to span two or more page sizes</FONT>. The index range is the size of one &#8220;set&#8221; of the cache, so with common 4-KB pages you can get aliases in an 8-KB direct-mapped cache or a 32-KB four-way set-associative cache.
