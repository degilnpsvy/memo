<FONT class=extract>The &#8220;page color&#8221; of a location is the value of those one or more virtual address bits that choose a page-sized chunk within the appropriate cache set.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Two virtual pointers to the same physical data can produce an alias only if they have a different page color.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>So long as all pointers to the same data have the same color, all is well&#8212;all the data, even though at different virtual addresses, will be stored in the same physical portion of the cache and will be correctly identified by the (common) physical tag.</FONT>
