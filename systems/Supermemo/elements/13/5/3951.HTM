Most of the time, the OS is able to over align virtual address choices for shared data&#8212;the sharing processes may not use the same address, but we&#8217;ll make sure their different virtual addresses are a multiple of, say, 64KB apart, so the different virtual addresses have the same color. That takes up a bit more virtual memory, but virtual memory is fairly cheap.
