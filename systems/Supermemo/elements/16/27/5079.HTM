<H4 class=docSection2Title>2.7.4 Remapping Keys</H4>
<P class=docText>Another major use of the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file is <A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1843></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1844></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1845></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1846></A>to redefine things about Emacs that irritate you. You may have ergonomic concerns about Emacs; more than one person has aggravated carpal tunnel syndrome using the default bindings. You may simply be used to reaching for certain keys for certain functions and would rather change Emacs than your habits. Whatever the case, this section gives a brief introduction to key remapping; for more details, see <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-10.html#gnu3-chp-10">Chapter 10</A>.</P>
<P class=docText>If you use the default bindings (rather than CUA mode), you may use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x u</SPAN> for undo.<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-2-sect-7.html#gnu3-chp-2-fnote-10">[10]</A></SUP> (Undo is such a common command that it's easy to type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-u</SPAN> by mistake when you undo repeatedly. Unfortunately, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-u</SPAN> is a disabled command for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>upcase-region</SPAN>. If you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-u</SPAN>, an annoying message about enabling the command pops up.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-FNOTE-10>[10]</A></SUP> You could use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-_</SPAN> for undo instead and then you wouldn't need to read this section. We recommend that you read it anyway because you might find another annoying key mapping that you want to change and this section tells a bit about how to do so.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText>If you don't anticipate a big need for upcasing regions, you can redefine <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-u</SPAN> so that it also runs <SPAN class=docEmphBold>undo</SPAN>. To do so, add this line to your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file:</P><PRE>(define-key global-map "\C-x\C-u" 'undo)
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>After making this change, typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-u</SPAN> runs undo, just as <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x u</SPAN> does.</P>
<P class=docText>Emacs customization is extremely powerful, and you can make Emacs work just the way you want it to. A far more extensive treatment of customization is found in <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-10.html#gnu3-chp-10">Chapter 10</A>. This brief introduction is meant to whet your appetite and to make it possible for you to add lines to your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file as we mention potential customizations throughout the book.</P>
<P class=docText>The next chapter covers topics such as the many searches offered by Emacs, including query-replace, as well as spell checking and word abbreviation mode (often used to correct typos automatically). If you want to learn about these features, go on to the next chapter. From here on, you can take a selective approach to reading this book, picking and choosing whatever you want to learn about; you don't need to read the rest of the book sequentially.
