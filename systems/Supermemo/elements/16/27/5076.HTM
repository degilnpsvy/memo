<H4 class=docSection2Title>2.7.1 Hiding the Toolbar</H4>
<P class=docText>New users may find the <A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1832></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1833></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1834></A>toolbar helpful. Others may not. It's easy to hide it by selecting Options<IMG src="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/images/ent/u2192.gif" border=0> Show/Hide<IMG src="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/images/ent/u2192.gif" border=0> Toolbar, and then Options<IMG src="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/images/ent/u2192.gif" border=0> Save Options.</P>
<P class=docText>When Emacs sets options for you through Custom (and this is what it is doing even when you use the Options menu), it writes your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file. If you already have a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file, it appends to it. Custom essentially groups all of its settings in one part of the file, and it is commented to indicate that you should not change it manually. Here's the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file that we created by selecting this option:</P><PRE> (custom-set-variables


  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.


  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.


  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.


  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.


 '(tool-bar-mode nil nil (tool-bar)))


(custom-set-faces


  ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.


  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.


  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.


  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.


 )

<P class=docText>This may seem a bit bulky, but as we'll see in the next section, Emacs adds this section only once and then augments it when you set more options either through the options menu or directly through the Custom interface. Also note that this auto-generated Lisp is certainly less clean than Lisp statements you'll typically see in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> files. That's another reason not to edit Custom's work directly.
