<H4 class=docSection2Title>2.7.2 Turning On CUA Mode for C-x, C-c, and C-v to Cut, Copy, and Paste</H4>
<P class=docText>If you're new to Emacs, <A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1835></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1836></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1837></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-2-ITERM-1838></A>you might be used to the Common User Access (CUA) conventions for cutting, copying, and pasting, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-v</SPAN> respectively. You might reach for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-z</SPAN> for undo. CUA mode was once an add-on mode that you had to install separately, but it became so popular that it is now part of Emacs. It's coded in a clever way that doesn't interfere with Emacs keystrokes that are prefixed with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN>. Details on CUA mode can be found in <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-13.html#gnu3-chp-13">Chapter 13</A>.</P>
<P class=docText>You can turn this feature on through the Options menu to try it out. Simply choose Options<IMG src="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/images/ent/u2192.gif" border=0> C-x/C-c/C-v cut and paste (CUA). After you select this option, a check mark appears next to it on the Options menu. To keep it for subsequent sections, select Save Options from the Options menu. Emacs writes your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file for you. If you turned off the toolbar and then set this option, your <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file would look like this (note that the line relating to CUA mode is bold so you can see the difference from the previous example):</P><PRE> (custom-set-variables


  ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.


  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.


  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.


  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.


 '<SPAN class=docEmphBold>(cua-mode t nil (cua-base))</SPAN>


 '(tool-bar-mode nil nil (tool-bar)))


(custom-set-faces


  ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.


  ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.


  ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.


  ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.


 )
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>Interestingly, Emacs happily writes the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>.emacs</SPAN> file even if it is open at the time. You can watch Emacs change the file if you have it open when you choose Save Options.
