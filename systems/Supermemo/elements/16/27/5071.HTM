Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they are over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as completed once you have done so. When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE with the TODO keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the agenda. The problem with this is, however, that then also the next instance of the repeated entry will not be active. Org mode deals with this in the following way: When you try to mark such an entry DONE (usingC-c C-t), it will shift the base date of the repeating timestamp by the repeater interval, and immediately set the entry state back to TODO77. In the example above, setting the state to DONE would actually switch the date like this: 
<P></P>
<P>** TODO Pay the rent</P>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;DEADLINE: &lt;2005-11-01 Tue +1m&gt; </P>
<P>A timestamp78 will be added under the deadline, to keep a record that you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline. As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no longer be visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future instances will be visible.
