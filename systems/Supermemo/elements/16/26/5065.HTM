You can also review the items of a specific TODO type in a sparse tree by using a numeric prefix to <KBD>C-c / t</KBD>. For example, to see all things Lucy has to do, you would use<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><KBD>C-3 C-c / t</KBD>. To collect Lucy's items from all agenda files into a single buffer, you would use the numeric prefix argument as well when creating the global TODO list:<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><KBD>C-3 C-c a t</KBD>.
