If you often think, "I know I'm writing about widgets, but I can't remember the bigger point I'm trying to make," type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN> to get to the next higher level of the outline. If you want to figure out how widgets relate to the other topics within the section, use <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-b</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> to move backward and forward to your other headings.
