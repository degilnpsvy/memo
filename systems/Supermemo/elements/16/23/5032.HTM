You built them by compiling some source code and gluing in some library functions&#8212;prebuilt binaries provided with your toolchain. But there are two things wrong with that. One is that the library code is often bigger than the application that attaches to it, bloating all the programs. The other is that if a supplier fixes a bug in a library function, you don&#8217;t get full benefit from the fix until every software maintainer rebuilds his or her application.
