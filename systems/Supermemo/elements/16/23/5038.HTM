To show all the hidden text in a file, whether headings or body, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-a</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>show-all</SPAN>). These commands, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>hide-body</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>show-all</SPAN>, work on the outline as a whole.
