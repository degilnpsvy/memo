After you are in outline mode, you can use special commands to move quickly from one part of the outline to another. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-n</SPAN> moves to the next heading or subheading; <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN> moves to the previous one. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> moves to the next heading of the same level, so you can use this command to move from one first-level heading to another throughout the outline, or from one second-level heading to another within a given entry. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-b</SPAN> moves backward to the previous heading of the same level. If you want to move from a second-level heading to its first-level heading, up a level in the outline structure, you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN>. (If you are on a first-level heading already, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-u</SPAN> beeps because it can't move to a higher level.)
