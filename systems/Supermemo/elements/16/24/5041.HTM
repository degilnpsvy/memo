The four Org commands org-store-link, org-capture, org-agenda, and org-iswitchb should be accessible through global keys (i.e., anywhere in Emacs, not just in Org buffers). Here are suggested bindings for these keys, please modify the keys to your own liking. </P>

<P>(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link) </P>
<P>(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture) </P>
<P>(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda) </P>
<P>(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
