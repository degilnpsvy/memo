For programming purposes, it&#8217;s easiest if the G bit is kept in the kernel&#8217;s page tables with the output-side fields. But when you&#8217;re translating, it belongs to the input side. On MIPS32/64 CPUs, the two output-side values are AND-ed together to produce the value that is used, but the realistic outcome is that you must make sure the G bit is set the same in both halves.
