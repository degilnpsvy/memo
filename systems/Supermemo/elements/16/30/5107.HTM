The ASID is 8 bits: The OS-aware reader will appreciate that even 256 is too small an upper limit for the number of simultaneously active processes on a big UNIX system. However, it&#8217;s a reasonable limit so long as &#8220;active&#8221; in this context is given the special meaning of &#8220;may have translation entries in the TLB.&#8221; OS software has to recycle ASIDs where necessary, which will involve purging the TLB of translation entries for any processes being down graded from active. It&#8217;s a dirty business, but so is quite a lot of what OSs have to do; and 256 entries should be enough to make sure it doesn&#8217;t have to be done so often as to constitute a performance problem.
