When MIPS was new, there could be up to 32 CP0 registers. But MIPS32/64 cater for up to 256, and for instruction backward-compatibility that&#8217;s been done by appending a 3-bit select field to the CP0 number (which is in fact encoded in a previously zero part of the instruction). So mtc0 s,$12,1 is interpreted as accessing &#8220;register 12, select 1.&#8221;We&#8217;ll write that as 12.1.
