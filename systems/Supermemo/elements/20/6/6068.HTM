Newlib does not include a filesystem, but it may seem like it requires one for proper operation&#8212;especially considering that it provides file-oriented functions like fprintf() and fseek(). However, although newlib likes to think that there is a stream-oriented filesystem working behind the scenes, its integration layer has been conveniently organized to not require this.
