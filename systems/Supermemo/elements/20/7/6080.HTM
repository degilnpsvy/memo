Remotes 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The repository you&#8217;re currently working in is called the local or current repository, and the repository with which you exchange files is called the remote repository. But the latter term is a bit of a misnomer, because the repository may or may not be on a physically remote or even different machine; it could conceivably be just another repository on a local filesystem. In Chapter 13, I discuss how the term upstream repository is usually used to identify the remote repository from which your local repository is derived via a clone operation.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Git uses both the remote and the remote-tracking branch to reference and facilitate the connection to another repository. The remote provides a friendly name for the repository and can be used in place of the actual repository URL. A remote also forms part of the name basis for the remote-tracking branches for that repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Use the git remote command to create, remove, manipulate, and view a remote. All the remotes you introduce are recorded in the .git/config file and can be manipulated using git config.</FONT></P>
<P>In addition to git clone, other common Git commands that refer to remote repositories are:</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>git fetch </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Retrieves objects and their related metadata from a remote repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>git pull </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Like git fetch, but also merges changes into a corresponding local branch.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>git push </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Transfers objects and their related metadata to a remote repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>git ls-remote </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Shows a list of references held by a given remote (on an upstream server). This command indirectly answers the question &#8220;Is an update available?&#8221;</FONT>
