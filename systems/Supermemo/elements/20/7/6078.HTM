Bare and Development Repositories 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A Git repository is either a bare or a development (nonbare) repository. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A development repository is used for normal, daily development. It maintains the notion of a current branch and provides a checked out copy of the current branch in a working directory. All of the repositories mentioned in the book so far have been development repositories.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>In contrast, a bare repository has no working directory and shouldn&#8217;t be used for normal development. A bare repository has no notion of a checked out branch, either. Think of a bare repository as simply the contents of the .git directory. In other words, you shouldn&#8217;t make commits in a bare repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A bare repository might seem to be of little use, but its role is crucial: to serve as an authoritative focal point for collaborative development. Other developers clone and fetch from the bare repository and push updates to it.</FONT> We&#8217;ll work through an example later in this chapter that shows how all this works together.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If you issue git clone with the --bare option, Git creates a bare repository; otherwise, a development repository is created.</FONT></P>
<P>Notice that we did not say that git clone --bare creates a new or empty repository. We said it creates a bare repository. And that newly cloned repository will contain a copy of the content from the upstream repository.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The command git init creates a new and empty repository, and that new repository can come in both development and bare variants. Also, be aware of how the --bare flag affects the directory that is initialized:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ cd /tmp </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ git init fluff2 </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/fluff2/.git/</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ git init --bare fluff </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/fluff/</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>By default, Git enables a reflog (a record of changes to refs) on development repositories but not on bare repositories. This again anticipates that development will take place in the former and not in the latter. By the same reasoning, no remotes are created in a bare repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If you set up a repository into which developers push changes, it should be bare. In effect, this is a special case of the more general best practice that a published repository should be bare.</FONT>
