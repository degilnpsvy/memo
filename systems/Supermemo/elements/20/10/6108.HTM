Pushing a Merged History 
<P></P>
<P>If you&#8217;ve performed all the steps shown, your repository has been updated to contain the latest changes from both the origin repository and your repository. But the converse is not true: the origin repository still doesn&#8217;t have your changes. </P>
<P>If your objective is only to incorporate the latest updates from origin into your repository, then you are finished when your merge is resolved. On the other hand, a simple git push can return the unified and merged history from your master branch back to the origin repository. Figure 12-7 shows the results after you git push.</P>
<P>Finally, observe that the origin repository has been updated with your development even if it has undergone other changes that had to be merged first. Both your repository and the origin repository have been fully updated and are again synchronized.
