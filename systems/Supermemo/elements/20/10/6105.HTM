Merging Histories </P>
<P>Now that both histories are present in one repository, all that is needed to unify them is a merge of the origin/master branch into the master branch. </P>
<P>The merge operation can be initiated either with a direct git merge origin/master command or as the second step in a git pull request. In both cases, the techniques for the merge operation are exactly the same as those described in Chapter 9.</P>
<P>Figure 12-6 shows the commit graph in your repository after the merge has successfully assimilated the two histories from commit D and Y into a new merge commit, M. The ref for origin/master remains pointing at D because it hasn&#8217;t changed, but master is updated to the merge commit, M, to indicate that the merge was into the master branch; this is where the new commit was made.
