Remote Configuration 
<P></P>
<P>Keeping track of all of the information about a remote repository reference by hand can become tedious and difficult: you have to remember the full URL for the repository; you must type and retype remote references and refspecs on the command line each time you want to fetch updates; you have to reconstruct the branch mappings; and so on. Repeating the information is also likely to be quite error prone. </P>
<P>You might also wonder how Git remembers the URL for the remote from the initial clone for use in subsequent fetch or push operations using origin.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Git provides three mechanisms for setting up and maintaining information about remotes: the git remote command, the git config command, and editing the .git/config file directly. All three mechanisms ultimately result in configuration information being recorded in the .git/config file.</FONT>
