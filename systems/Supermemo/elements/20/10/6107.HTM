Merge Conflicts </P>
<P>Occasionally there will be merge conflicts between the alternate histories. Regardless of the outcome of the merge, the fetch still occurred. All the commits from the remote repository are still present in your repository on the tracking branch. </P>
<P>You may choose to resolve the merge normally, as described in Chapter 9, or you may choose to abort the merge and reset your master branch to its prior ORIG_HEAD state using the command git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD. Doing so in this example would move master to the prior HEAD value, Y, and change your working directory to match. It would also leave origin/master at commit D.</P>
<P>You can brush up on the meaning of ORIG_HEAD by reviewing &#8220;refs and symrefs&#8221; on page 68 of Chapter 6; also see its use in the section &#8220;Aborting or Restarting a Merge&#8221; on page 137 (Chapter 9).
