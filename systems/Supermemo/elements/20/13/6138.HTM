Separate Commit and Publish Steps </P>
<P>One of the clear advantages of a distributed VCS is the separation of commit and publish. </P>
<P>A commit just saves a state in your private repository; publishing through patches or push/pull makes the change public, which effectively freezes the repository history.</P>
<P>Other VCSs, such as CVS or SVN, have no such conceptual separation. To make a commit, you must publish it simultaneously.</P>
<P>By making commit and publish separate steps, a developer is much more likely to make precise, mindful, small, and logical steps with patches. Indeed, any number of small changes can be made without affecting any other repository or developer. The commit operation is offline in the sense that it requires no network access to record positive, forward steps within your own repository.</P>
<P>Git also provides mechanisms for refining and improving commits into nice, clean sequences prior to making them public. Once you are ready, the commits can be made public in a separate operation.
