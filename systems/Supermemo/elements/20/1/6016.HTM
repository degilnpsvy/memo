You can also copy text from the kill ring to the search string by typing C-s C-y. After you've given this command, you can press <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>M-p</FONT></SPAN> to see previous items from the kill ring. <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> takes you to the next item if you've gone back with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-p</SPAN>.
