Referencing Other Repositories 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>To coordinate your repository with another repository, you define a remote, which here means a named entity stored in the config file of a repository. It consists of two different parts. The first part states the name of the other repository in the form of a URL. The second part, called a refspec, specifies how a ref (which usually represents a branch) should be mapped from the namespace of one repository into the namespace of the other repository. </FONT></P>
