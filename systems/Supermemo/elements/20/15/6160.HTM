Reconciling forks 
<P></P>
<P>In contrast, Git tries to remove the stigma of forking. The real problem with forking a project is not the creation of an alternate development path. Every time a developer downloads or clones a copy of a project and starts hacking on it, she has created an alternative development path, if only temporarily. </P>
<P>In his work on the Linux Kernel, Linus Torvalds eventually realized that forking is only a problem if the forks don&#8217;t eventually merge back together. Thus, he designed Git to look at forking totally differently: Git encourages forking. But Git also makes it easy for anyone to merge two forks whenever they want.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Technically, reconciling a forked project with Git is facilitated by its support for largescale fetching and importing one repository into another and for extremely easy branch merging.</FONT></P>
<P>Although many social issues may remain, fully distributed repositories seem to reduce tensions by lessening the perceived importance of the person at the center of a project. Because an ambitious developer can easily inherit a project and its complete history, he may feel it is enough to know that, if needed, the person at the center could be replaced and development could still continue!
