<P>Remote Repository Development Cycle in Pictures </P>
<P>Integrating your local development with changes from an upstream repository is at the very core of the distributed development cycle in Git. Let&#8217;s take a moment to visualize what happens to both your local repository and an upstream origin repository during clone and pull operations. A few pictures should also clarify the often confusing uses of the same name in different contexts. </P>
<P>Let&#8217;s start with the simple repository shown in Figure 12-1 as the basis for discussion. </P>

<P>Figure 12-1. Simple repository with commits</P>
<P>As with all of our commit graphs, the sequence of commits flows from left to right and the master label points to the HEAD of the branch. The two most recent commits are labeled A and B. Let&#8217;s follow these two commits, introduce a few more, and watch what occurs.</P></BODY>
