The fetch step 
<P></P>
<P>In the first fetch step, Git locates the remote repository. Because the command line did not specify a direct repository URL or a direct remote name, it assumes the default remote name, origin. The information for that remote is in the configurationfile: </P>
<P>[remote "origin"] </P>
<P>url = /tmp/Depot/public_html.git </P>
<P>fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</P>
<P>Git now knows to use the URL /tmp/Depot/public_html as the source repository. Furthermore, because the command line didn&#8217;t specify a refspec, Git will use all of the fetch = lines from the remote entry. Thus, every refs/heads/* branch from the remote will be fetched.</P>
<P>Next, Git performs a negotiation protocol with the source repository to determine what new commits are in the remote repository and are absent from your repository, based on the desire to fetch all of the refs/heads/* refs as given in the fetch refspec. You don&#8217;t have to fetch all of the topic branches from the remote repository using the refs/heads/* wildcard form. If you want only a particular branch or two, list them explicitly:</P>
<P>[remote "newdev"] </P>
<P>url = /tmp/Depot/public_html.git </P>
<P>fetch = +refs/heads/dev:refs/remotes/origin/dev </P>
<P>fetch = +refs/heads/stable:refs/remotes/origin/stable</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The pull output prefixed by remote: reflects the negotiation, compression, and transfer protocol, and it lets you know that new commits are coming into your repository. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>remote: Counting objects: 5, done. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Git places the new commits in your repository on an appropriate remote-tracking branch and then tells you what mapping it uses to determine where the new commits belong:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>From /tmp/Depot/public_html </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>3958f68..55c15c8 master -&gt; origin/master</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Those lines indicate that Git looked at the remote repository /tmp/Depot/public_html, took its master branch, brought its contents back to your repository, and placed them on your origin/master branch. This process is the heart of branch tracking.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The corresponding commit IDs are also listed, just in case you want to inspect the changes directly. With that, the fetch step is finished.</FONT>
