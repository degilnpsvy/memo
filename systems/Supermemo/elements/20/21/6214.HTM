CHAPTER 18 Using Git with Subversion Repositories </P>
<P>As you become more and more comfortable with Git, you&#8217;ll likely find it harder and harder to work without such a capable tool. But sometimes you&#8217;ll have to do without Git&#8212;say, if you work with a team whose source code is managed by some other VCS. (SVN, for example, is popular among open source projects.) Luckily, the Git developers have created numerous plug-ins to import and synchronize source code revisions with other systems. </P>
<P>This chapter demonstrates how to use Git when the rest of your team employs SVN. This chapter also provides guidance if more of your teammates want to make the switch to Git, and it explains what to do if your team wants to drop SVN entirely.
