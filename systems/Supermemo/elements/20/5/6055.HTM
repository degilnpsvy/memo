To select a different buffer in another window, type<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. Many users find these commands preferable to the normal <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-f</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x b</SPAN> commands because they save you a step: you need not move to the window, give a command, and move back.
