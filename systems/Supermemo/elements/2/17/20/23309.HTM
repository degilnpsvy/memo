<P class=docList>Remote (cross) debugging enables symbolic debugging using host development workstation resources for the heavy lifting, preserving often scarce target resources.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><TT>gdbserver</TT> runs on the target system and acts as the glue between the cross-gdb running on a development host and the process being debugged on the target.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>GDB on the host typically uses IP connections via Ethernet to send and receive commands to <TT>gdbserver</TT> running on the target. The GDB remote serial protocol is used between GDB and <TT>gdbserver.</TT></P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>GDB can halt on shared library events and can automatically load shared library symbols when available. Your toolchain should be configured for the default paths on your cross-development system. Alternatively, you can use GDB commands to set the search paths for shared library objects.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>GDB can be used to debug multiple independent processes via multiple concurrent GDB sessions.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>GDB can be configured to follow a forked process on a <TT>fork()</TT> system call. Its default mode is to continue to debug the parentthat is, the caller of <TT>fork().</TT></P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>GDB has features to facilitate debugging multithreaded applications written to POSIX thread APIs. The current default Linux thread library is the Native Posix Threads Library (NPTL).</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>GDB supports attaching to and detaching from an already running process.</P></LI></UL><A name=ch15lev2sec8></A>
