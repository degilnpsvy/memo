GOTCHA: A common bug report is enabling the framebuffer without enabling the<BR>framebuffer console.&nbsp; Depending on the driver, you may get a blanked or<BR>garbled display, but the system still boots to completion.&nbsp; If you are<BR>fortunate to have a driver that does not alter the graphics chip, then you<BR>will still get a VGA console.
