Each directory in /sys/class/vtconsole has 3 files:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ls /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp; ..&nbsp; bind&nbsp; name&nbsp; uevent</P>
<P>What do these files signify?</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. bind - this is a read/write file. It shows the status of the driver if<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; read, or acts to bind or unbind the driver to the virtual consoles<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when written to. The possible values are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;0 - means the driver is not bound and if echo'ed, commands the driver<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to unbind</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - means the driver is bound and if echo'ed, commands the driver to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bind</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. name - read-only file. Shows the name of the driver in this format:</P>
<P>&nbsp;cat /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/name<BR>&nbsp;(S) VGA+</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '(S)' stands for a (S)ystem driver, ie, it cannot be directly<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; commanded to bind or unbind</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'VGA+' is the name of the driver</P>
<P>&nbsp;cat /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon1/name<BR>&nbsp;(M) frame buffer device</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this case, '(M)' stands for a (M)odular driver, one that can be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directly commanded to bind or unbind.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. uevent - ignore this file</P>
<P>When unbinding, the modular driver is detached first, and then the system<BR>driver takes over the consoles vacated by the driver. Binding, on the other<BR>hand, will bind the driver to the consoles that are currently occupied by a<BR>system driver.
