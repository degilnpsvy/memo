The way to use magic numbers is to declare then at the beginning of<BR>the structure, like so:</P>
<P>struct tty_ldisc {<BR>&nbsp;int&nbsp;magic;<BR>&nbsp;...<BR>};</P>
<P>Please follow this discipline when you are adding future enhancements<BR>to the kernel!&nbsp; It has saved me countless hours of debugging,<BR>especially in the screwy cases where an array has been overrun and<BR>structures following the array have been overwritten.&nbsp; Using this<BR>discipline, these cases get detected quickly and safely.
