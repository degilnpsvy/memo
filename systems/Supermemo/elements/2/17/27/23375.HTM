NOTE2: If any of the virtual consoles are in KD_GRAPHICS mode, then binding or<BR>unbinding will not succeed. An example of an application that sets the console<BR>to KD_GRAPHICS is X.</P>
<P>How useful is this feature? This is very useful for console driver<BR>developers. By unbinding the driver from the console layer, one can unload the<BR>driver, make changes, recompile, reload and rebind the driver without any need<BR>for rebooting the kernel. For regular users who may want to switch from<BR>framebuffer console to VGA console and vice versa, this feature also makes<BR>this possible. (NOTE NOTE NOTE: Please read fbcon.txt under Documentation/fb<BR>for more details).
