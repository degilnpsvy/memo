<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Flash memory</SPAN><A name="not need"></A> is rewritable storage that does not need power supply to hold information. Flash memory banks are usually organized into <SPAN class=docEmphasis>sectors.</SPAN><A name="preceded by"></A> Unlike conventional storage, writes to flash addresses have to be preceded by an erase of the corresponding locations. Moreover, erases of portions of flash can be performed only at the granularity of individual sectors. Because of these constraints, flash memory is best used with device drivers and filesystems that are tailored to suit them. On Linux, such specially designed drivers and filesystems are provided by the MTD subsystem.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="NOR and"></A>Flash memory chips generally come in two flavors: NOR and NAND. <SPAN class=docEmphasis>NOR</SPAN><A name=whereas></A> is the variety used to store firmware images on embedded devices, whereas <SPAN class=docEmphasis>NAND</SPAN><A name="but imperfect"></A> is used for large, dense, cheap, but imperfect<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch17.html#ch17fn01">[1]</A></SUP><A name="required by"></A> storage as required by solid-state mass storage media such as USB pen drives and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Disk-On-Modules</SPAN><A name="NOR flash"></A> (DOMs). NOR flash chips are connected to the processor via address and data lines like normal RAM, but NAND flash chips are interfaced using I/O and control lines. So, code resident on NOR flash can be executed in place, but that stored on NAND flash has to be copied to RAM before execution.</P>
