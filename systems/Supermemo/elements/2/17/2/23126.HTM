<P class=docText><A name="At one"></A>At one end of today's on-the-move connectivity spectrum, there are standards that allow coupling between cellular networks and WiFi to provide cheaper networking solutions. At the other end, technologies such as Bluetooth and Infrared are being integrated into GPRS cell phones to bridge consumer electronics devices with the Internet. <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch16lev1sec5.html#ch16fig07">Figure 16.7</A><A name="sample scenario"></A> shows a sample scenario.</P><A name=ch16fig07></A>

<P class=docText><A name="there is"></A>In tandem with the coupling of existing standards and technologies, there is a steady stream of new communication standards arriving in the wireless space.</P>
<P class=docText>Zigbee (<A class=docLink href="http://www.zigbee.org/" target=_blank>www.zigbee.org</A><A name="wireless networking"></A>) adopts the new 802.15.4 standard for wireless networking in the embedded space that is characterized by low range, speed, energy consumption, and code footprint. It primarily targets home and industrial automation. Of the wireless protocols discussed in this chapter, Zigbee is closest to Bluetooth but is considered complementary rather than competitive with it.</P>
<P class=docText>WiMax (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>Worldwide interoperability for Microwave access</SPAN>), based on the IEEE 802.16 standard, is a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>metropolitan-area network</SPAN><A name="It supports"></A> (MAN) flavor of WiFi that has a range of several kilometers. It supports fixed connectivity for homes and offices, and a mobile version for networking on the go. WiMax is a cost-effective way to solve the last-mile connectivity problem (which is analogous to the task of reaching your home from the nearest metro rail station) and create broadband clouds that span large areas. The WiMax forum is hosted at <A class=docLink href="http://www.wimaxforum.org/" target=_blank>www.wimaxforum.org</A>.</P>
<P class=docText>MIMO (<SPAN class=docEmphasis>Multiple In Multiple Out</SPAN><A name="and WiMax"></A>) is a new multiple-antenna technology utilized by WiFi and WiMax products to enhance their speed, range, and connectivity.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="ambit of"></A>Working groups are developing new standards that fall under the ambit of fourth-generation or 4G networking. 4G will signal the convergence of several communication technologies.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="new communication"></A>Some of the new communication technologies are transparent to the operating system and work unchanged with existing drivers and protocol stacks. Others such as Zigbee need new drivers and protocol stacks but do not have accepted open source implementations yet. Linux mirrors the state of the art, so look out for support for these new standards in future kernel releases.
