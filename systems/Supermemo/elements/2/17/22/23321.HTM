<P class=docList>Linux is increasingly being used in systems where real-time performance is required. Examples include multimedia applications and robot, industrial, and automotive controllers.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Real-time systems are characterized by deadlines. When a missed deadline results in inconvenience or a diminished customer experience, we refer to this as soft real time. In contrast, hard real-time systems are considered failed when a deadline is missed.</P></LI>

<P class=docList>Kernel preemption was the first significant feature in the Linux kernel that addressed system-wide latency.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Recent Linux kernels support several preemption modes, ranging from no preemption to full real-time preemption.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>The real-time patch adds several key features to the Linux kernel, resulting in reliable low latencies.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>The real-time patch includes several important measurement tools to aid in debugging and characterizing a real-time Linux implementation.</P></LI></UL><A name=ch17lev2sec22></A>
