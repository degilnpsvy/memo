<H3 id=700181-963 class=docSection1Title>8.6. Chapter Summary</H3>
<P class=docText>This chapter presented a high-level overview of device driver basics and how they fit into the architecture of a Linux system. Armed with the basics, readers new to device drivers can jump into one of the excellent texts devoted to device driver writers. Consult <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EmbeddedLinuxPrimer/0136130550/ch08lev1sec6.html#ch08lev2sec16">Section 8.6.1</A> for references.</P>

<P class=docList>Device drivers enforce a rational separation between unprivileged user applications and critical kernel resources such as hardware and other devices, and present a well-known unified interface to applications.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>The minimum infrastructure to load a device driver is only a few lines of code. We presented this minimum infrastructure and built on the concepts to a simple shell of a driver module.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Device drivers configured as loadable modules can be inserted into and removed from a running kernel after kernel boot.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Module utilities are used to manage the insertion, removal, and listing of device driver modules. We covered the details of the module utilities used for these functions.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Device nodes on your file system provide the glue between your userspace application and the device driver.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Driver methods implement the familiar open, read, write, and close functionality commonly found in UNIX/Linux device drivers. This mechanism was explained by example, including a simple user application to exercise these driver methods.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>We concluded this chapter with an introduction to the relationship between kernel device drivers and the Open Source GNU Public License.</P></LI></UL><A name=ch08lev2sec16></A>
