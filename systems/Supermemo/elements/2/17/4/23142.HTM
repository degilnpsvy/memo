Look at the sidebar "<A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch18lev1sec2.html#ch18sb02">Choosing a Processor and Peripherals</A><A name="important factors"></A>" for some important factors that hardware designers and product managers consider while choosing components for building an embedded device. In today's world, where time to market is often the critical factor driving device design, the software engineer also has a considerable say in shaping component selection. Availability of a Linux distribution can influence processor choice, while existence of device drivers or close starting points can affect the choice of peripheral chipsets.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="needs to"></A>Although the kernel engineer needs to do due diligence and evaluate several Linux distributions (or even operating systems), he may nix a technologically superior distribution in favor of a familiar one if he believes that'll mitigate project risks. Or a preferred distribution might be the one that offers indemnification from lawsuits arising out of kernel bugs, if that is a crucial consideration in the relevant industry domain. The electrical engineer can limit evaluation to processors supported by the chosen distribution and prefer peripheral chipsets enabled by the distribution in question.</P><A name=ch18sb02></A>

<P class=docText><A name="managers ask"></A>Let's look at some common questions that electrical engineers and product managers ask when selecting components for an embedded device. Assume that a hypothetical processor <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="because it"></A> is on the shortlist because it satisfies basic product requirements such as power consumption and packaging. <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> and accompanying peripheral chipsets are under evaluation:</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Performance:</SPAN><A name="target applications"></A> Is the processor frequency sufficient to drive target applications? If the embedded device intends to implement CPU-intensive tasks, does the MIPS budgeting for all software subsystems balance with the processor's MIPS rating? If the target device requires high-resolution imaging, for example, will the MHz impact of graphics manipulation drag down the performance of other subsystems, such as networking?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Cost:</SPAN><A name="on the"></A> Will I save a buck on the component but end up spending two more on the surrounding electronics? For example, will <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="in an"></A> need an extra regulator? Will I need to throw in an additional accessory, for example, an RTC chip, because <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> does not have one built-in? Does <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="evaluation leading"></A> have more pins than other processors under evaluation leading to a denser board having a larger number of layers and vias that increase the raw board cost? Does <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="consume more"></A> consume more power and generate more heat necessitating a bigger power supply and additional passive components? Is there errata in the data sheet that has the possibility of increasing software development costs?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Functionality:</SPAN><A name="size of"></A> What's the maximum size of DRAM, SRAM, NOR, and NAND memory that <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> can address?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Business Planning:</SPAN> Does <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="path to"></A>'s vendor offer an upgrade path to a higher horsepower processor that is a drop-in (pin-compatible) replacement? Is the vendor company stable?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Supplier:</SPAN><A name="If so"></A> Is this a single-source component? If so, is the supplier volatile? What are the lead times to procure the parts?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>End-of-Life:</SPAN> Is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN> likely to go end-of-life before the expected lifespan of the embedded device?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Credibility:</SPAN> Is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>P</SPAN><A name="segment behind"></A> an accepted component? Do peripheral chipsets under evaluation have an industry segment behind them? Perhaps a landscape LCD under consideration is being used on automobile dashboards?</P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Ruggedness:</SPAN><A name="MIL "></A> Need the components be MIL (military) or industrial grade?</P>
<P class=docText><A name="figure out"></A>One has to evaluate different candidates and figure out the sweet spot in terms of all these.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
