<H3 id=700181-865 class=docSection1Title>1.1. Why Linux?</H3>
<P class=docText>Because of the numerous economic and technical benefits, we are seeing strong growth in the adoption of Linux for embedded devices. This trend has crossed virtually all markets and technologies. Linux has been adopted for embedded products in the worldwide public switched telephone network, global data networks, wireless cellular handsets, and the equipment that operates these networks. Linux has enjoyed success in automobile applications, consumer products such as games and PDAs, printers, enterprise switches and routers, and many other products. The adoption rate of embedded Linux continues to grow, with no end in sight.</P>
