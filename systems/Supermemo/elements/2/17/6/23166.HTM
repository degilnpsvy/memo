<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>FireWire</SPAN><A name="or IEEE"></A>, or IEEE 1394, is a high-speed serial bus protocol invented by Apple for connecting peripheral devices to a system. It provides data rates of up to 800Mbps (IEEE 1394b). <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch10lev1sec1.html#ch10fig01">Figure 10.1</A> in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</A><A name="connection of"></A> shows the connection of the FireWire controller on an x86-based laptop.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="USB "></A>FireWire is similar to USB 2.0 in that both are external I/O buses that support high speeds and device hotplugging. FireWire, however, is a peer-to-peer protocol, unlike the master-slave USB 2.0, so two FireWire-enabled devices can exchange information without the intervention of a PC. Because of this characteristic, FireWire is popular on multimedia devices such as camcorders. As you learned in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</A><A name="capability to"></A>, the On-The-Go supplement brings peer-to-peer capability to USB 2.0, too.</P>

<LI>
<P class=docList>Device drivers such as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ohci1394</SPAN> that interface with FireWire controllers.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Protocol drivers for applications such as storage, video, and networking. The FireWire <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Serial Bus Protocol 2</SPAN><A name="your FireWire"></A> (SBP2) driver is a low-level FireWire protocol driver that lets you use your FireWire storage media as you would use a SCSI disk or a USB mass storage device. SBP2 has to be used in tandem with a high-level SCSI driver such as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>sd_mod</SPAN> (for disks) or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>sr_mod</SPAN> (for CD-ROMs). Applications such as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>cdrecord</SPAN><A name="drives just"></A> work over FireWire CD drives just as they work with USB CD drives. The <SPAN class=docEmphasis>dv1394</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>video1394</SPAN><A name="via FireWire"></A> protocol drivers enable you to capture video via FireWire, and the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>eth1394</SPAN><A name="over FireWire"></A> protocol driver lets you run TCP/IP over FireWire.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="previously mentioned"></A>A FireWire core that provides services to both previously mentioned.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>User-space libraries such as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>libraw1394</SPAN> that assist in developing FireWire-aware applications.</P></LI></UL>
<P class=docText>Look at <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/ieee1394/*</SPAN> for FireWire kernel sources and go to <A class=docLink href="http://www.linux1394.org/" target=_blank>www.linux1394.org</A> for detailed documentation.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="slimmer FireWire"></A>Starting with the 2.6.22 release, the kernel has an alternate, slimmer FireWire stack living in the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/firewire/</SPAN> directory.
