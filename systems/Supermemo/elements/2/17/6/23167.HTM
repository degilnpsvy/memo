<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="Intelligent Input"></A>Intelligent Input/Output</SPAN><A name="standard that"></A> (or I2O) is a standard that calls for offloading I/O activities from the main processor to an I/O coprocessor residing on an I2O adapter. I2O is largely defunct today, and the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>I2O Special Interest Group</SPAN><A name="operating systems"></A> (I2O SIG) has ceased to exist. However, many operating systems, including Linux, continue support for I2O.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="for technologies"></A>I2O hardware is available for technologies such as SCSI, RAID, and networking. I2O partitions the software architecture into an <SPAN class=docEmphasis>OS-specific module</SPAN> (OSM) running on the main processor and a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>hardware-specific module</SPAN><A name="operating systems"></A> (HDM) executing on the I2O adapter. HDMs are OS-agnostic and can be reused across operating systems, so the OSMs are rendered simpler.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="form of"></A>Linux supports I2O in the form of an I2O core, drivers for I2O adapters, and various OSMs. Look at the Linux I2O home page at <A class=docLink href="http://i2o.shadowconnect.com/" target=_blank>http://i2o.shadowconnect.com</A> and the sources in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/message/i2o/</SPAN> for more details.
