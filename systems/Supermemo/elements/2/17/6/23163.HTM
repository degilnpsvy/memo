<P class=docText><A name="Notebook computers"></A>Notebook computers and their derivatives usually contain a built-in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>embedded controller</SPAN><A name="care of"></A> (EC) to take care of various side responsibilities, including the following:</P>

<P class=docText><A name="functions are"></A>Most of these functions are specific to the OEM's hardware implementation. Different OEMs use different ECs; IBM/Lenovo laptops, for example, embed a Renesas H8 microcontroller to assist the main processor. The interface to access the EC, however, is standard irrespective of the make of the controller. The BIOS and the operating system operate on I/O port <TT>0x80</TT> to read information from the EC and I/O port <TT>0x81</TT><A name="to the"></A> to write data to the EC. On desktops, these ports provide access to the keyboard controller rather than to a general-purpose EC.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to an"></A>The next section refers to an example driver that detects telemetry strength by accessing EC memory space.
