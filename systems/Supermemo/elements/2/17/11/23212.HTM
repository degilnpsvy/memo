<P class=docText>One of the fundamental factors driving the adoption of Linux is the fact that it is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>open source</SPAN>. The Linux kernel is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EmbeddedLinuxPrimer/0136130550/ch01lev1sec3.html#ch01fn01">[1]</A></SUP> (General Public License), which leads to the popular myth that Linux is free.<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EmbeddedLinuxPrimer/0136130550/ch01lev1sec3.html#ch01fn02">[2]</A></SUP> In fact, the second paragraph of the GNU GPL declares: "When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price." The GPL license is remarkably short and easy to read. Among the most important key characteristics:</P>

<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=ch01fn02>[2]</A></SUP> Most professional development managers agree: You can download Linux without charge, but there is a cost (often a substantial one) for development and deployment of any OS on an embedded platform.

<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=ch01fn03>[3]</A></SUP> If all the copyright holders agreed, the software could, in theory, be released under a new license, a very unlikely scenario indeed!</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=docText>No matter how the software was obtained, the GPL grants the licensee unlimited distribution rights, without the obligation to pay royalties or per-unit fees. This does not mean that a vendor can't charge for the GPL softwarethis is a very reasonable common business practice. It means that once in possession of GPL software, it is permissible to modify and redistribute it, whether it is a derived (modified) work or not. However, as defined by the GPL license, the author(s) of the modified work are obligated to release the work under the terms of the GPL if they decide to do so. Any distribution of a derived work, such as shipment to a customer, triggers this obligation.</P>

<H4 id=title-IDAQXOWD class=docSection2Title>1.3.1. Free Versus Freedom</H4>
<P class=docText>Two popular phrases are often repeated in the discussion about the free nature of open source: "free as in freedom" and "free as in beer." (The author is particularly fond of the latter.) The GPL license exists to guarantee "free as in freedom" of a particular body of software. It guarantees your freedom to use it, study it, and change it. It also guarantees these freedoms for anyone to whom you distribute your modified code. This concept has become fairly widely understood.</P>
<P class=docText>One of the misconceptions frequently heard is that Linux is "free as in beer." Sure, you can obtain Linux free of cost. You can download a Linux kernel in a few minutes. However, as any professional development manager understands, certain <A name=iddle1829></A><A name=iddle1830></A><A name=iddle1831></A><A name=iddle1837></A><A name=iddle2052></A><A name=iddle2167></A><A name=iddle2175></A><A name=iddle2438></A><A name=iddle2439></A><A name=iddle2440></A>costs are associated with any software to be incorporated into a design. These include the costs of acquisition, integration, modification, maintenance, and support. Add to that the cost of obtaining and maintaining a properly configured toolchain, libraries, application programs, and specialized cross-development tools compatible with your chosen architecture, and you can quickly see that it is a nontrivial exercise to develop the needed software components to deploy your embedded Linux-based system.
