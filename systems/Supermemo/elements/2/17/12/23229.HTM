<H3 id=title-IDAQ0ZKH class=docSection1Title>4.4. Obtaining a Linux Kernel</H3>
<P class=docText><A name=iddle1379></A><A name=iddle1759></A>In general, you can obtain an embedded Linux kernel for your hardware platform in three ways: You can purchase a suitable commercial embedded Linux distribution; you can download a free embedded distribution, if you can find one suitable for your particular architecture and processor; or you can find the closest open-source Linux kernel to your application and port it yourself. We discuss Linux porting in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EmbeddedLinuxPrimer/0136130550/ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</A>, "Porting Linux."</P>
<P class=docText>Although porting an open source kernel to your custom board is not necessarily difficult, it represents a significant investment in engineering/development resources. This approach gives you access to free software, but deploying Linux in your development project is far from free, as we discussed in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EmbeddedLinuxPrimer/0136130550/ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</A>, "Introduction." Even for a small system with minimal application requirements, you need many more components than just a Linux kernel.</P><A name=ch04lev2sec15></A>
<H4 id=title-IDAB2ZKH class=docSection2Title>4.4.1. What Else Do I Need?</H4>
<P class=docText>This chapter has focused on the layout and construction of the Linux kernel itself. As you might have already discovered, Linux is only a small component of an embedded system based on Linux. In addition to the Linux kernel, you need the following components to develop, test, and launch your embedded Linux widget:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Bootloader ported to and configured for your specific hardware platform</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Cross-compiler and associated toolchain for your chosen architecture</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>File system containing many packagesbinary executables and libraries compiled for your native hardware architecture/processor</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Device drivers for any custom devices on your board</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Development environment, including host tools and utilities</P></LI>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Linux kernel source tree enabled for your particular processor and board</P></LI></UL>
<P class=docText>These are the components of an embedded Linux distribution.
