fbcon=vc:&lt;n1&gt;-&lt;n2&gt; 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;This option tells fbcon to take over only a range of consoles as<BR>&nbsp;specified by the values 'n1' and 'n2'. The rest of the consoles<BR>&nbsp;outside the given range will still be controlled by the standard<BR>&nbsp;console driver.</P>
<P>&nbsp;NOTE: For x86 machines, the standard console is the VGA console which<BR>&nbsp;is typically located on the same video card.&nbsp; Thus, the consoles that<BR>&nbsp;are controlled by the VGA console will be garbled.
