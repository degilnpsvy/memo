fbcon=map:&lt;0123&gt; 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an interesting option. It tells which driver gets mapped to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which console. The value '0123' is a sequence that gets repeated until<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the total length is 64 which is the number of consoles available. In<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the above example, it is expanded to 012301230123... and the mapping<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;tty | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;fb&nbsp; | 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 ...</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;('cat /proc/fb' should tell you what the fb numbers are)</P>
<P>&nbsp;One side effect that may be useful is using a map value that exceeds<BR>&nbsp;the number of loaded fb drivers. For example, if only one driver is<BR>&nbsp;available, fb0, adding fbcon=map:1 tells fbcon not to take over the<BR>&nbsp;console.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Later on, when you want to map the console the to the framebuffer<BR>&nbsp;device, you can use the con2fbmap utility.
