<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="User Mode"></A>User Mode Linux</SPAN> (UML), hosted at <A class=docLink href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/" target=_blank>http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/</A><A name="debug the"></A>, lets you debug the kernel without "oops"ing the machine. To accomplish this, an instance of the kernel (called the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>guest</SPAN><A name="mode process"></A> kernel) runs as a user mode process over the running kernel (called the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>host</SPAN> kernel).</P>
<P class=docText><A name="It can"></A>UML has diverse users. It can function as an environment for testing kernel and application code, a vehicle to experiment with unstable kernels, a secure pseudo computer for hosting services such as web servers, or a tool to learn Linux internals. UML is more useful for debugging hardware-independent portions of the kernel than for device driver debugging.
