<P class=docText><A name="You can"></A>You can't execute a serious project without the services of a robust version control repository. A version control system helps manage multiple versions of source code and regulates file accesses by team members. Concurrent Versions System or CVS (<A class=docLink href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs" target=_blank>www.nongnu.org/cvs</A><A name="open source"></A>) is an open source revision control software that has been around for a long time and comes bundled with many Linux distributions. Another versioning system called subversion (<A class=docLink href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target=_blank>http://subversion.tigris.org</A><A name="intended replacement"></A>) was developed as an intended replacement for CVS. Git (<A class=docLink href="http://git.or.cz/" target=_blank>http://git.or.cz</A><A name="control system"></A>) is the version control system of choice for kernel developers and is used to maintain several open source projects, including the Linux kernel. Ample documentation on these systems is available on the Internet.
