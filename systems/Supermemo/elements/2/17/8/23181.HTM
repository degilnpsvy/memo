<P class=docText><A name="It goes"></A>It goes without saying that you need the full complement of relevant test equipment for device driver debugging. If you are testing a modem interface in a digital-only laboratory environment for example, you will be well served by a phone simulator. If a high-speed serial driver is manifesting parity errors, an oscilloscope will aid your problem analysis. If you are writing an I/O device driver, it will help if you have the associated bus analyzer. If you are writing a network driver, the corresponding protocol line sniffer will ease your debugging effort.
