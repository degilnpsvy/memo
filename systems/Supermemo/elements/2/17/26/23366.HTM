As you already know, a frame buffer device is a memory device like /dev/mem and<BR>it has the same features. You can read it, write it, seek to some location in<BR>it and mmap() it (the main usage). The difference is just that the memory that<BR>appears in the special file is not the whole memory, but the frame buffer of<BR>some video hardware.
