<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>What Next?</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="Linux is"></A>Linux is here to stay, but internal kernel interfaces tend to get fossilized as soon as someone figures out a cleverer way of doing things. No kernel code is etched in stone. As you learned, even the scheduler, considered sacred, has undergone two rewrites since the 2.4 days. The number of new lines of code appearing in the kernel tree runs into the millions each year. As the kernel evolves, new features and abstractions keep getting added, programming interfaces redesigned, subsystems restructured for extracting better performance, and reusable regions filtered into common cores.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="have a"></A>You now have a solid foundation, so you can adapt to these changes. To maintain your cutting-edge, refresh your kernel tree regularly, browse the kernel mailing list frequently, and write code whenever you can. Linux is the future, and being a kernel guru pays. Stay at the front lines!
