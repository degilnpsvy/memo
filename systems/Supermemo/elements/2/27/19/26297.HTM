threads</P>
<P>Threads in a wait queue go to sleep until they are woken up by another thread or an interrupt handler that is responsible for detecting the event. Queuing and dequeuing are respectively done using <FONT class=clozed><TT>add_wait_queue()</TT> and <TT>remove_wait_queue()</TT></FONT>, and waking up queued tasks is accomplished via <TT><FONT class=clozed>wake_up_interruptible()</FONT></TT>.
