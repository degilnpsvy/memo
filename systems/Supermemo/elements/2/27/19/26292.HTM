A typical task for an interrupt handler is <FONT class=clozed>awakening processes sleeping on the device if the interrupt signals the event they&#8217;re waiting for, such as the arrival of new data. To stick with the frame grabber example, a process could acquire a sequence of images by continuously reading the device; the read call blocks before reading each frame, while the interrupt handler awakens the process as soon as each new frame arrives. This assumes that the grabber interrupts the processor to signal successful arrival of each new frame.</FONT></FONT>
