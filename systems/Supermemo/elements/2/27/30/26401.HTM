the device namespace, the bus namespace, and property namespaces. </P>
<P>The device namespace contains the names of qdev devices. qdev supports the ability to have anonymous devices. Anonymous devices are usually created through composition and are anonymous because the user controls the device namespace and the user has no way of allocating names for devices created through composition. </P>
<P>The bus namespace is parallel to the device namespace. Unlike the device namespace, busses cannot be anonymous. For busses that are created as a result of composition, a name is derived either from the device name or via the type name. </P>
<P>In qdev, implicit bus names are not considered stable and may change across invocations and/or versions of QEMU. </P>
<P>Property namespaces are local to devices. The 'id' property is reserved to refer to the name of the device. Property names do not reference child devices. </P>
<P>Paths cannot be meaningfully constructed in QDev. Devices can only be addressed directly by their name as there is no stable way to refer to busses under a device, or children under a bus.
