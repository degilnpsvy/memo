<P>The two main concepts in QDev are devices and busses. A device is represented by a DeviceState and a bus is represented by a BusState. They do not share a common base class. Devices can have properties but busses cannot. A device has no direct relationship with other devices. The only relationship is indirect through busses. </P>
<P>A device may have zero or more busses associated with it via a has-a relationship. Each child bus may have multiple devices associated with it via a reference. All devices have a single parent bus and all busses have a single parent device. These relationships form a strict tree where every alternating level is a bus level followed by a device level. The root of the tree is the main system bus often referred to as SysBus.
