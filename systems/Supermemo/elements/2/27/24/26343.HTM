If your application uses or <SPAN class=structname>GObject</SPAN> features, it must be compiled and linked with the options returned by the following <SPAN class=application>pkg-config</SPAN> invocation: 
<P></P><PRE class=programlisting>$ pkg-config <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>

<P>If your application uses modules, it must be compiled and linked with the options returned by one of the following <SPAN class=application>pkg-config</SPAN> invocations: </P><PRE class=programlisting>$ pkg-config <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>
$ pkg-config <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>
