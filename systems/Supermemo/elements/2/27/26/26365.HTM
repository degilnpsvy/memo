<P>Before you can configure the more advanced parts of your system, it's a good idea to learn how the system is organized and what commands can be used to search for files and programs. It's also good to know if you need to compile a custom kernel and what the steps for doing that are. This chapter will familiarize you with system organization and configuration files. Then, you can move on to configuring the more advanced parts of the system.
