<H2 class=title>GObject builder</H2></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>In order to help a GObject class developer, one obvious idea is to use some sort of templates for the skeletons and then run them through a special tool to generate the real C files. <A class=ulink href="http://www.5z.com/jirka/gob.html" target=_top>GOB</A> (or GOB2) is such a tool. It is a preprocessor which can be used to build GObjects with inline C code so that there is no need to edit the generated C code. The syntax is inspired by Java and Yacc or Lex. The implementation is intentionally kept simple: the inline C code provided by the user is not parsed. </P></DIV>
