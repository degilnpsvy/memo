As a kset contains a kobject within it, it should always be dynamically<BR>created and never declared statically or on the stack.&nbsp; To create a new<BR>kset use:<BR><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> 
<P></P>
<P>When you are finished with the kset, call:<BR>&nbsp; void kset_unregister(struct kset *kset);<BR>to destroy it.
