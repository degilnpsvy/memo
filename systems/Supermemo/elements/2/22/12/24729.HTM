A kset is also a subdirectory in sysfs, where the associated kobjects<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; with the kset can show up.&nbsp; Every kset contains a kobject which can be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; set up to be the parent of other kobjects; the top-level directories of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the sysfs hierarchy are constructed in this way.
