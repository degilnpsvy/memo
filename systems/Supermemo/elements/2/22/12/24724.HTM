As the name of the kobject is set when it is added to the kernel, the name<BR>of the kobject should never be manipulated directly.&nbsp; If you must change<BR>the name of the kobject, call <FONT class=clozed>kobject_rename(): </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int kobject_rename(struct kobject *kobj, const char *new_name);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>kobject_rename does not perform any locking or have a solid notion of<BR>what names are valid so the caller must provide their own sanity checking<BR>and serialization</FONT>.
