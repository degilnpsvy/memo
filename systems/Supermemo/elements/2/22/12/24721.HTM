A kset is a group of kobjects.&nbsp; These kobjects can be of the same ktype<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; or belong to different ktypes.&nbsp; The kset is the basic container type for<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; collections of kobjects. Ksets contain their own kobjects, but you can<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; safely ignore that implementation detail as the kset core code handles<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; this kobject automatically.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; When you see a sysfs directory full of other directories, generally each<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; of those directories corresponds to a kobject in the same kset.
