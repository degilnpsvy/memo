After calling kobject_init(), to<BR>register the kobject with sysfs, the function <FONT class=clozed>kobject_add()</FONT> must be called: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int kobject_add(struct kobject *kobj, struct kobject *parent, const char *fmt, ...);</P>
<P>This sets up the parent of the kobject and the name for the kobject<BR>properly.&nbsp; If the kobject is to be associated with a specific kset,<BR>kobj-&gt;kset must be assigned before calling kobject_add().&nbsp; If a kset is<BR>associated with a kobject, then the parent for the kobject can be set to<BR>NULL in the call to kobject_add() and then the kobject's parent will be the<BR>kset itself.
