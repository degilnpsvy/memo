Kobjects are generally not interesting on their own; instead, they are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; usually embedded within some other structure which contains the stuff<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the code is really interested in. 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; No structure should EVER have more than one kobject embedded within it.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does, the reference counting for the object is sure to be messed<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; up and incorrect, and your code will be buggy.&nbsp; So do not do this.
