After a kobject has been registered with the kobject core successfully, it<BR>must be cleaned up when the code is finished with it.&nbsp; To do that, call<BR><FONT class=clozed>kobject_put().&nbsp; By doing this, the kobject core will automatically clean up<BR>all of the memory allocated by this kobject.&nbsp; If a KOBJ_ADD uevent has been<BR>sent for the object, a corresponding KOBJ_REMOVE uevent will be sent, and<BR>any other sysfs housekeeping will be handled for the caller properly.</FONT>
