<FONT class=clozed>kobject_del</FONT>() can be used to drop the reference to the parent object, if<BR>circular references are constructed.&nbsp; It is valid in some cases, that a<BR>parent objects references a child.&nbsp; Circular references _must_ be broken<BR>with an explicit call to kobject_del(), so that a release functions will be<BR>called, and the objects in the former circle release each other.
