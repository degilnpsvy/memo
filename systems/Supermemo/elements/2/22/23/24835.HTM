If you need to do a two-stage delete of the kobject (say you are not<BR>allowed to sleep when you need to destroy the object), then call<BR><FONT class=clozed>kobject_del</FONT>() which will unregister the kobject from sysfs.&nbsp; This makes the<BR>kobject "invisible", but it is not cleaned up, and the reference count of<BR>the object is still the same.&nbsp; At a later time call <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>() to <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>.
