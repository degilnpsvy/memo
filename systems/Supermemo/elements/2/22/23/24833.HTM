If you need to do a two-stage delete of the kobject (say you are not<BR>allowed to sleep when you need to destroy the object), then call<BR><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>() which will unregister the kobject from sysfs.&nbsp; This makes <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>.&nbsp; 
<P></P>
<P>At a later time call kobject_put() to finish<BR>the cleanup of the memory associated with the kobject.
