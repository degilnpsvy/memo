Up until now we've been blitting our images raw. Since we were only showing one image, it didn't matter. When you're making a game, blitting images raw causes needless slow down. We'll be converting them to an optimized format to speed them up. 
<P></P>
<P>See when you load a bitmap, it's typically loaded in a 24bit format since most bitmaps are 24bit. Most, if not all, modern displays are not 24bit by default. If we blit an image that's 24bit onto a 32bit image, SDL will convert it every single time the image is blitted. </P>
<P>So what we're going to do when an image is loaded is convert it to the same format as the screen so no conversion needs to be done on blit. This can be done easily with <FONT class=clozed>SDL_ConvertSurface. All we have to do is pass in the surface want to convert with the format of the screen. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>It's important to note that SDL_ConvertSurface returns a copy of the original in a new format. The original loaded image is still in memory after this call. This means we have to free the original loaded surface or we'll have two copies of the same image in memory.</FONT><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'; COLOR: #aaaaaa; FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt" lang=EN-US><BR></P></SPAN>
