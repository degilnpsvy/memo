<DT>Inline Functions</DT>
<DD>Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can be included in many different compilations. Hopefully they can usually be inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is necessary, if the address of the function is taken or if inlining fails. In general, we emit an out-of-line copy in all translation units where one is needed. As an exception, we only emit inline virtual functions with the vtable, since it always requires a copy.
<P>Local static variables and string constants used in an inline function are also considered to have vague linkage, since they must be shared between all inlined and out-of-line instances of the function.<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><BR></P></DD>
<DT>VTables</DT>
<DD><A name=index-vtable-3800></A>C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a lookup table, known as a vtable. The vtable contains pointers to the virtual functions provided by a class, and each object of the class contains a pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some multiple-inheritance situations). If the class declares any non-inline, non-pure virtual functions, the first one is chosen as the &#8220;key method&#8221; for the class, and the vtable is only emitted in the translation unit where the key method is defined.
<P><EM>Note:</EM><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the vtable is still emitted in every translation unit that defines it. Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class body, even if they are not defined there.<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><BR></P></DD>
<DT><CODE>type_info</CODE><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>objects</DT>
<DD><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007btype_005finfo_007d-3801></A><A name=index-RTTI-3802></A>C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to implement &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>dynamic_cast</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>typeid</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and exception handling. For polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>type_info</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; object is written out along with the vtable so that &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>dynamic_cast</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; can determine the dynamic type of a class object at run time. For all other types, we write out the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>type_info</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; object when it is used: when applying &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>typeid</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; to an expression, throwing an object, or referring to a type in a catch clause or exception specification.<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><BR></DD>
