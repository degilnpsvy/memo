Another wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be specified with a variable that you set with a command line argument to <CODE>make</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Overriding">Overriding Variables</A>). For example, <PRE class=example><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></PRE>
<P class=noindent>means that the command &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make extradeps=foo.h</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will consider <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.h</SPAN></SAMP> as a prerequisite of each object file, but plain &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will not.
