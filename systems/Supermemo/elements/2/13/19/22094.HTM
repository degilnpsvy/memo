Transition Bus Drivers<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>By defining wrapper functions, the transition to the new model can be<BR>made easier. Drivers can ignore the generic structure altogether and<BR>let the bus wrapper fill in the fields. For the callbacks, the bus can<BR>define generic callbacks that forward the call to the bus-specific<BR>callbacks of the drivers. </P>
<P>This solution is intended to be only temporary. In order to get class<BR>information in the driver, the drivers must be modified anyway. Since<BR>converting drivers to the new model should reduce some infrastructural<BR>complexity and code size, it is recommended that they are converted as<BR>class information is added.
