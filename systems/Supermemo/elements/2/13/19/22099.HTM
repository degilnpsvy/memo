Initialization<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>The driver must initialize at least the<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> fields. It should<BR>also initialize the devclass field (when it arrives), so it may obtain<BR>the proper linkage internally. It should also initialize as many of<BR>the callbacks as possible, though each is optional.
