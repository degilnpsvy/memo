sysfs<BR>~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>When a driver is registered, a sysfs directory is created in its<BR><FONT class=clozed>bus</FONT>'s directory. In this directory, the driver can export an interface<BR>to userspace to control operation of the driver on a global basis;<BR>e.g. toggling debugging output in the driver.</P>
<P>A future feature of this directory will be a 'devices' directory. This<BR>directory will contain symlinks to the directories of devices it<BR>supports.
