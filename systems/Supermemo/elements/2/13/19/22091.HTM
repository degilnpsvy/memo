Initialization<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>The driver must initialize at least the<FONT class=clozed> name and bu</FONT>s fields. It should<BR>also initialize the <FONT class=clozed>devclass</FONT> field (when it arrives), so it may obtain<BR>the proper linkage internally. It should also initialize as many of<BR>the callbacks as possible, though each is optional.
