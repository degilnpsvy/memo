CONFIGURING the kernel: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; version.&nbsp; New configuration options are added in each release, and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; as expected.&nbsp; If you want to carry your existing configuration to a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; new version with minimal work, use "<SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>", which will<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; only ask you for the answers to new questions.
