It should be noted that on some operating systems, SDL_Init() will fail if SDL_main() has not been defined as the entry point for the program. Calling <FONT class=clozed>SDL_SetMainReady()</FONT> prior to SDL_Init() will circumvent this failure condition, however, users should be careful when calling SDL_SetMainReady() as improper initalization may cause crashes and hard to diagnose problems.
