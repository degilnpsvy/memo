<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Notifier chains</SPAN><A name="messages to"></A> are used to send status change messages to code regions that request them. Unlike hard-coded mechanisms, notifiers offer a versatile technique for getting alerted when events of interest are generated. Notifiers were originally added for passing network events to concerned sections of the kernel but are now used for many other purposes. The kernel implements predefined notifiers for significant events. Examples of such notifications include the following:</P>

<LI>
<P class=docList><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Die notification</SPAN><A name="a trap"></A>, which is sent when a kernel function triggers a trap or a fault, caused by an "oops," page fault, or a breakpoint hit. If you are, for example, <A name=iddle1627></A><A name=iddle1793></A><A name=iddle2187></A><A name=iddle2212></A><A name=iddle2418></A><A name=iddle3139></A><A name=iddle3212></A><A name=iddle3300></A><A name=iddle3302></A><A name=iddle3303></A><A name="a device"></A>writing a device driver for a medical grade card, you might want to register yourself with the die notifier so that you can attempt to turn off the medical electronics if a kernel panic occurs.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>Net device notification</SPAN>, which is generated when a network interface goes up or down.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList><SPAN class=docEmphStrong>CPU frequency notification</SPAN><A name="processor frequency"></A>, which is dispatched when there is a transition in the processor frequency.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList><SPAN class=docEmphStrong><A name="Internet address"></A>Internet address notification</SPAN><A name="sent when"></A>, which is sent when a change is detected in the IP address of a network interface.</P></LI></UL>
