<H4 class=subsection>5.4.2 Input During Parallel Execution</H4>
<P><A name=index-input-during-parallel-execution-359></A><A name=index-parallel-execution_002c-input-during-360></A><A name=index-standard-input-361></A>Two processes cannot both take input from the same device at the same time. To make sure that only one recipe tries to take input from the terminal at once, <CODE>make</CODE> will invalidate the standard input streams of all but one running recipe. If another recipe attempts to read from standard input it will usually incur a fatal error (a &#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217; signal). <A name=index-broken-pipe-362></A>It is unpredictable which recipe will have a valid standard input stream (which will come from the terminal, or wherever you redirect the standard input of <CODE>make</CODE>). The first recipe run will always get it first, and the first recipe started after that one finishes will get it next, and so on. 
<P>We will change how this aspect of <CODE>make</CODE> works if we find a better alternative. In the mean time, you should not rely on any recipe using standard input at all if you are using the parallel execution feature; but if you are not using this feature, then standard input works normally in all recipes.
