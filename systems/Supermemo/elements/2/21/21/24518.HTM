Softirqs are the basic bottom half mechanism and have <FONT class=clozed>strong locking</FONT> requirements. They are used only by a few <FONT class=clozed>performance-sensitive subsystems such as the networking layer, SCSI layer, and kernel timers</FONT>. <FONT class=extract>Tasklets are built on top of softirqs and are easier to use. It's recommended to use tasklets unless you have crucial scalability or speed requirements.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>A primary difference between a softirq and a tasklet is that the former is reentrant whereas the latter isn't. Different instances of a softirq can run simultaneously on different processors, but that is not the case with tasklets.</FONT>
