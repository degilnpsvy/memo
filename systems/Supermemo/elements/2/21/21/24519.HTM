Tasklets are built on top of softirqs and are easier to use. It's recommended to use tasklets unless you have crucial scalability or speed requirements. A primary difference between a softirq and a tasklet is that the former is reentrant whereas the latter isn't. Different instances of a softirq can run simultaneously on different processors, but that is not the case with tasklets.
