<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>Hash tables are implemented using an array of <TT>hlist_head</TT>s.</FONT> Each <TT>hlist_head</TT> sources a doubly linked list of <TT>hlist_node</TT><A name=the></A>s. A hash function is used to locate the index (or bucket) in the <TT>hlist_head</TT><A name="When that"></A> array. When that is done, you may use hlist helper routines (also defined in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>include/linux/list.h</SPAN><A name="on the"></A>) to operate on the list of <TT>hlist_nodes</TT><A name="to the"></A> linked to the chosen bucket. Look at the implementation of the directory cache (dcache) in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>fs/dcache.c</SPAN> for an example.
