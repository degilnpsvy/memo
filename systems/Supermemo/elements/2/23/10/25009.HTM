Because the #+BEGIN_... and #+END_... patterns need to be added so often, shortcuts are provided using the Easy Templates facility (see Easy Templates).

<P>C-c ' </P>
<P>Edit the source code example at point in its native mode. This works by switching to a temporary buffer with the source code. You need to exit by pressing C-c 'again122. The edited version will then replace the old version in the Org buffer. Fixed-width regions (where each line starts with a colon followed by a space) will be edited using artist-mode123 to allow creating ASCII drawings easily. Using this command in an empty line will create a new fixed-width region. </P>
<P>C-c l </P>
<P>Calling org-store-link while editing a source code example in a temporary buffer created with C-c ' will prompt for a label. Make sure that it is unique in the current buffer, and insert it with the proper formatting like &#8216;(ref:label)&#8217; at the end of the current line. Then the label is stored as a link &#8216;(label)&#8217;, for retrieval withC-c C-l~.
