&nbsp;* *_power_efficient_wq are inclined towards saving power and converted<BR>&nbsp;* into WQ_UNBOUND variants if 'wq_power_efficient' is enabled; otherwise,<BR>&nbsp;* they are same as their non-power-efficient counterparts - e.g.<BR>&nbsp;* system_power_efficient_wq is identical to system_wq if<BR>&nbsp;* 'wq_power_efficient' is disabled.&nbsp; See WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT for more info.
