3.1) Introduction <FONT class=extract>TCG instructions operate on variables which are temporaries, local temporaries or globals. TCG instructions and variables are strongly typed. Two types are supported: 32 bit integers and 64 bit integers. Pointers are defined as an alias to 32 bit or 64 bit integers depending on the TCG target word size.</FONT> <FONT class=extract><FONT class=extract>Each instruction has a fixed number of output variable operands, input variable operands and always constant operands.</FONT> The notable exception is the call instruction which has a variable number of outputs and inputs.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>In the textual form, output operands usually come first, followed by input operands, followed by constant operands. The output type is included in the instruction name. Constants are prefixed with a '$'. add_i32 t0, t1, t2 (t0 &lt;- t1 + t2)</FONT>
