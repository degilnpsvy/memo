4.2) Constraints 
<P></P>
<P>GCC like constraints are used to define the constraints of every instruction. Memory constraints are not supported in this version. Aliases are specified in the input operands as for GCC. 
<P>The same register may be used for both an input and an output, even when they are not explicitly aliased. If an op expands to multiple target instructions then care must be taken to avoid clobbering input values. GCC style "early clobber" outputs are not currently supported. 
<P>A target can define specific register or constant constraints. If an operation uses a constant input constraint which does not allow all constants, it must also accept registers in order to have a fallback. 
<P>The movi_i32 and movi_i64 operations must accept any constants. 
<P>The mov_i32 and mov_i64 operations must accept any registers of the same type. 
<P>The ld/st instructions must accept signed 32 bit constant offsets. It can be implemented by reserving a specific register to compute the address if the offset is too big. 
<P>The ld/st instructions must accept any destination (ld) or source (st) register.
