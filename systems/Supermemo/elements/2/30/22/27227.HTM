4.3) Function call assumptions 
<P></P>
<P>- The only supported types for parameters and return value are: 32 and 64 bit integers and pointer. </P>
<P>- The stack grows downwards. </P>
<P>- The first N parameters are passed in registers. </P>
<P>- The next parameters are passed on the stack by storing them as words. </P>
<P>- Some registers are clobbered during the call. </P>
<P>- The function can return 0 or 1 value in registers. On a 32 bit target, functions must be able to return 2 values in registers for 64 bit return type.
