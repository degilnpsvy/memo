3.3) Code Optimizations </P>
<P>When generating instructions, you can count on at least the following optimizations: </P>
<P>- Single instructions are simplified, e.g. and_i32 t0, t0, $0xffffffff is suppressed. </P>
<P>- A liveness analysis is done at the basic block level. </P>
<P>The information is used to suppress moves from a dead variable to another one. It is also used to remove instructions which compute dead results. The later is especially useful for condition code optimization in QEMU. </P>
<P>In the following example: </P>
<P>add_i32 t0, t1, t2 </P>
<P>add_i32 t0, t0, $1 </P>
<P>mov_i32 t0, $1 </P>
<P>only the last instruction is kept.
