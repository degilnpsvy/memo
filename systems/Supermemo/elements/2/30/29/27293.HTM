<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;* Perform a "reciprocal multiplication" in order to "scale" a value into<BR>&nbsp;* range [0, ep_ro), where the upper interval endpoint is right-open.<BR>&nbsp;* This is useful, e.g. for accessing a index of an array containing<BR>&nbsp;* ep_ro elements, for example. Think of it as sort of modulus, only that<BR>&nbsp;* the result isn't that of modulo. ;) Note that if initial input is a<BR>&nbsp;* small value, then result will return 0.<BR>&nbsp;*
