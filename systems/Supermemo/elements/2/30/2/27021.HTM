once for each read or<BR>write. This forces the following behavior on the method<BR>implementations: 
<P></P>
<P>- On read(2), the show() method should fill the entire buffer. <BR>&nbsp; Recall that an attribute should only be exporting one value, or an<BR>&nbsp; array of similar values, so this shouldn't be that expensive. </P>
<P>&nbsp; This allows userspace to do partial reads and forward seeks<BR>&nbsp; arbitrarily over the entire file at will. If userspace seeks back to<BR>&nbsp; zero or does a pread(2) with an offset of '0' the show() method will<BR>&nbsp; be called again, rearmed, to fill the buffer.</P>
<P>- On write(2), sysfs expects the entire buffer to be passed during the<BR>&nbsp; first write. Sysfs then passes the entire buffer to the store()<BR>&nbsp; method. <BR>&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; When writing sysfs files, userspace processes should first read the<BR>&nbsp; entire file, modify the values it wishes to change, then write the<BR>&nbsp; entire buffer back. </P>
<P>&nbsp; Attribute method implementations should operate on an identical<BR>&nbsp; buffer when reading and writing values.
