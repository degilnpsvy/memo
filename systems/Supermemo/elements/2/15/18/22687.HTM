1.9 Other event types, handling output events<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>The other event types up to now are:</P>
<P>EV_LED - used for the keyboard LEDs.<BR>EV_SND - used for keyboard beeps.</P>
<P>They are very similar to for example key events, but they go in the other<BR>direction - from the system to the input device driver. If your input device<BR>driver can handle these events, it has to set the respective bits in evbit,<BR>*and* also the callback routine:</P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;button_dev-&gt;event = button_event;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>int button_event(struct input_dev *dev, unsigned int type, unsigned int code, int value);<BR>{<BR>&nbsp;if (type == EV_SND &amp;&amp; code == SND_BELL) {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;outb(value, BUTTON_BELL);<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<BR>&nbsp;}<BR>&nbsp;return -1;<BR>}</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>This callback routine can be called from an interrupt or a BH (although that<BR>isn't a rule), and thus must not sleep, and must not take too long to finish</FONT>.
