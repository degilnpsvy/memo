1.3 Basic event types<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The most simple event type is EV_KEY, which is used for keys and buttons.<BR>It's reported to the input system via:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;input_report_key(struct input_dev *dev, int code, int value)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>See linux/input.h for the allowable values of code (from 0 to KEY_MAX).<BR>Value is interpreted as a truth value, ie any nonzero value means key<BR>pressed, zero value means key released. The input code generates events only<BR>in case the value is different from before.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>In addition to EV_KEY, there are two more basic event types: EV_REL and<BR>EV_ABS. They are used for relative and absolute values supplied by the<BR>device. A relative value may be for example a mouse movement in the X axis.<BR>The mouse reports it as a relative difference from the last position,<BR>because it doesn't have any absolute coordinate system to work in. Absolute<BR>events are namely for joysticks and digitizers - devices that do work in an<BR>absolute coordinate systems.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Having the device report EV_REL buttons is as simple as with EV_KEY, simply<BR>set the corresponding bits and call the</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;input_report_rel(struct input_dev *dev, int code, int value)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>function. Events are generated only for nonzero value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>However EV_ABS requires a little special care. Before calling<BR>input_register_device, you have to fill additional fields in the input_dev<BR>struct for each absolute axis your device has. If our button device had also<BR>the ABS_X axis:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;button_dev.absmin[ABS_X] = 0;<BR>&nbsp;button_dev.absmax[ABS_X] = 255;<BR>&nbsp;button_dev.absfuzz[ABS_X] = 4;<BR>&nbsp;button_dev.absflat[ABS_X] = 8;</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Or, you can just say:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;input_set_abs_params(button_dev, ABS_X, 0, 255, 4, 8);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>This setting would be appropriate for a joystick X axis, with the minimum of<BR>0, maximum of 255 (which the joystick *must* be able to reach, no problem if<BR>it sometimes reports more, but it must be able to always reach the min and<BR>max values), with noise in the data up to +- 4, and with a center flat<BR>position of size 8.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If you don't need absfuzz and absflat, you can set them to zero, which mean<BR>that the thing is precise and always returns to exactly the center position<BR>(if it has any).</FONT>
