1.8 Key autorepeat<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>... is simple. It is handled by the<FONT class=clozed> input.</FONT>c module. Hardware autorepeat is<BR>not used, because it's not present in many devices and even where it is<BR>present, it is broken sometimes (at keyboards: Toshiba notebooks). To enable<BR>autorepeat for your device, just set <FONT class=clozed>EV_REP in dev-&gt;evbit</FONT>. All will be<BR>handled by the input system.
