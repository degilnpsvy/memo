1.6 The keycode, keycodemax, keycodesize fields<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>
<P>These three fields should be used by input devices that have dense keymaps.<BR>The keycode is an array used to map from scancodes to input system keycodes.<BR>The keycode max should contain the size of the array and keycodesize the<BR>size of each entry in it (in bytes).</P>
<P>Userspace can query and alter current scancode to keycode mappings using<BR>EVIOCGKEYCODE and EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctls on corresponding evdev interface.<BR>When a device has all 3 aforementioned fields filled in, the driver may<BR>rely on kernel's default implementation of setting and querying keycode<BR>mappings.
