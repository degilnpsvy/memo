Then it allocates a new input device structure with input_allocate_device()<BR>and sets up input bitfields. This way the device driver tells the other<BR>parts of the input systems what it is - what events can be generated or<BR>accepted by this input device. Our example device can only generate EV_KEY<BR>type events, and from those only BTN_0 event code. Thus we only set these<BR>two bits. We could have used 
<P><FONT class=clozed></FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;set_bit(EV_KEY, button_dev.evbit);<BR>&nbsp;set_bit(BTN_0, button_dev.keybit)</FONT>;</P>
<P>as well, but with more than single bits the first approach tends to be<BR>shorter.
