Before calling input_register_device, you have to fill additional fields in the input_dev struct for each absolute axis your device has. If our button device had also the ABS_X axis: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;button_dev.absmin[ABS_X] = 0;<BR>&nbsp;button_dev.absmax[ABS_X] = 255;<BR>&nbsp;button_dev.absfuzz[ABS_X] = 4;<BR>&nbsp;button_dev.absflat[ABS_X] = 8;</P>
<P>Or, you can just say:</P>
<P>&nbsp;input_set_abs_params(button_dev, ABS_X, 0, 255, 4, 8);</P>
<P>This setting would be appropriate for a joystick X axis, with the minimum of<BR>0, maximum of 255 (which the joystick *must* be able to reach, no problem if<BR>it sometimes reports more, but it must be able to always reach the min and<BR>max values), with noise in the data up to +- 4, and with a center flat<BR>position of size 8.</P>
<P>If you don't need absfuzz and absflat, you can set them to zero, which mean<BR>that the thing is precise and always returns to exactly the center position<BR>(if it has any).
