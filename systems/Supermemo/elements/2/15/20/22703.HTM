In addition to EV_KEY, there are two more basic event types: EV_REL and<BR>EV_ABS. They are used for relative and absolute values supplied by the<BR>device. A relative value may be for example a mouse movement in the X axis.<BR>The mouse reports it as a relative difference from the last position,<BR>because it doesn't have any absolute coordinate system to work in. Absolute<BR>events are namely for joysticks and digitizers - devices that do work in an<BR>absolute coordinate systems.
