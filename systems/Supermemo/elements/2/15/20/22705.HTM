<P>The other event types up to now are:</P>
<P>EV_LED - used for the keyboard LEDs.<BR>EV_SND - used for keyboard beeps.</P>
<P>They are very similar to for example key events, but they go in the other<BR>direction - from the system to the input device driver. If your input device<BR>driver can handle these events, it has to set the respective bits in evbit,<BR>*and* also the callback routine:<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
