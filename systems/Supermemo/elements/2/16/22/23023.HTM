<P class=docText><A name="Power management"></A>Power management is critical on devices running on battery, such as laptops and handhelds. Linux drivers need to be aware of power states and have to transition across states in response to events such as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>standby, sleep</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>low battery.</SPAN><A name="features supported"></A> Drivers utilize power-saving features supported by the underlying hardware when they switch to modes that consume less power. For example, the storage driver spins down the disk, whereas the video driver blanks the display.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="in device"></A>Power-aware code in device drivers is only one piece of the overall power management framework. Power management also features participation from user space daemons, utilities, configuration files, and boot firmware. Two popular power management mechanisms are APM (discussed in the section, "<A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/app02lev1sec2.html#app02lev1sec2">Protected Mode Calls</A>" in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/app02.html#app02">Appendix B</A>, "Linux and the BIOS") and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface</SPAN><A name="de facto"></A> (ACPI). APM is getting obsolete, and ACPI has emerged as the de facto power <A name=iddle1838></A><A name=iddle2678></A><A name=iddle4227></A><A name="is further"></A>management strategy on Linux systems. ACPI is further discussed in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch20.html#ch20">Chapter 20</A>, "More Devices and Drivers."</P>
