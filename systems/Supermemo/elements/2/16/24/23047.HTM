<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>What's I<SUP>2</SUP>C/SMBus?</H3>
<P class=docText>I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="is widely"></A>C is a serial bus that is widely used in desktops and laptops to interface the processor with devices such as EEPROMs, audio codecs, and specialized chips that monitor parameters such as temperature and power-supply voltage. In addition, I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="communicate with"></A>C is widely used in embedded devices to communicate with RTCs, smart battery circuits, multiplexers, port expanders, optical transceivers, and other similar devices. Because I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="is supported"></A>C is supported by a large number of microcontrollers, there are loads of cheap I<SUP>2</SUP>C devices available in the market today.</P>
<P class=docText>I<SUP>2</SUP><A name=a></A>C and SMBus are master-slave protocols where communication takes place between a <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="host adapter"></A>host adapter</SPAN> (or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>host controller</SPAN>) and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>client devices</SPAN> (or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>slaves</SPAN><A name="adapter is"></A>). The host adapter is usually part of the South Bridge chipset on desktops and part of the microcontroller on embedded devices. <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch08.html#ch08fig01">Figure 8.1</A><A name="an example"></A> shows an example I<SUP>2</SUP>C bus on PC-compatible hardware.</P>

The two wires are <SPAN class=docEmphasis>clock</SPAN> and bidirectional <SPAN class=docEmphasis>data</SPAN><A name=called></A>, and the corresponding lines are called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Serial CLock</SPAN> (SCL) and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Serial DAta</SPAN> (SDA). Because the I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="less space"></A>C bus needs only a pair of wires, it consumes less space on the circuit board. However, the supported bandwidths are also low. I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="standard mode"></A>C allows up to 100Kbps in the standard mode and 400Kbps in a fast mode. (SMBus supports only up to 100Kbps, however.) The bus is thus suitable only for slow peripherals. Even though I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="because there"></A>C supports bidirectional exchange, the communication is half duplex because there is only a single data wire.</P>
<P class=docText>I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="and SMBus"></A>C and SMBus devices own 7-bit addresses. The protocol also supports 10-bit addresses, but many devices respond only to 7-bit addressing, which yields a maximum of 127 devices on the bus. Due to the master-slave nature of the protocol, device addresses are also known as <SPAN class=docEmphasis>slave addresses</SPAN>.
