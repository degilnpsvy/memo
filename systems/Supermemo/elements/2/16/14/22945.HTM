<P>VFIO virtual device<BR>===================</P>
<P></P>
<P>Device types supported:<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_TYPE_VFIO</P>
<P>Only one VFIO instance may be created per VM.&nbsp; The created device<BR>tracks VFIO groups in use by the VM and features of those groups<BR>important to the correctness and acceleration of the VM.&nbsp; As groups<BR>are enabled and disabled for use by the VM, KVM should be updated<BR>about their presence.&nbsp; When registered with KVM, a reference to the<BR>VFIO-group is held by KVM.</P>
<P>Groups:<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_VFIO_GROUP</P>
<P>KVM_DEV_VFIO_GROUP attributes:<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_VFIO_GROUP_ADD: Add a VFIO group to VFIO-KVM device tracking<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_VFIO_GROUP_DEL: Remove a VFIO group from VFIO-KVM device tracking</P>
<P>For each, kvm_device_attr.addr points to an int32_t file descriptor<BR>for the VFIO group.
