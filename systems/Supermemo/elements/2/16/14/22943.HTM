<P>MPIC interrupt controller<BR>=========================</P>
<P></P>
<P>Device types supported:<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_TYPE_FSL_MPIC_20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freescale MPIC v2.0<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_TYPE_FSL_MPIC_42&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freescale MPIC v4.2</P>
<P>Only one MPIC instance, of any type, may be instantiated.&nbsp; The created<BR>MPIC will act as the system interrupt controller, connecting to each<BR>vcpu's interrupt inputs.</P>
<P>Groups:<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_MPIC_GRP_MISC<BR>&nbsp; Attributes:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KVM_DEV_MPIC_BASE_ADDR (rw, 64-bit)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Base address of the 256 KiB MPIC register space.&nbsp; Must be<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naturally aligned.&nbsp; A value of zero disables the mapping.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset value is zero.</P>
<P>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_MPIC_GRP_REGISTER (rw, 32-bit)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access an MPIC register, as if the access were made from the guest.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "attr" is the byte offset into the MPIC register space.&nbsp; Accesses<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; must be 4-byte aligned.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MSIs may be signaled by using this attribute group to write<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the relevant MSIIR.</P>
<P>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_MPIC_GRP_IRQ_ACTIVE (rw, 32-bit)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IRQ input line for each standard openpic source.&nbsp; 0 is inactive and 1<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is active, regardless of interrupt sense.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For edge-triggered interrupts:&nbsp; Writing 1 is considered an activating<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; edge, and writing 0 is ignored.&nbsp; Reading returns 1 if a previously<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signaled edge has not been acknowledged, and 0 otherwise.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "attr" is the IRQ number.&nbsp; IRQ numbers for standard sources are the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; byte offset of the relevant IVPR from EIVPR0, divided by 32.</P>
<P>IRQ Routing:</P>
<P>&nbsp; The MPIC emulation supports IRQ routing. Only a single MPIC device can<BR>&nbsp; be instantiated. Once that device has been created, it's available as<BR>&nbsp; irqchip id 0.</P>
<P>&nbsp; This irqchip 0 has 256 interrupt pins, which expose the interrupts in<BR>&nbsp; the main array of interrupt sources (a.k.a. "SRC" interrupts).</P>
<P>&nbsp; The numbering is the same as the MPIC device tree binding -- based on<BR>&nbsp; the register offset from the beginning of the sources array, without<BR>&nbsp; regard to any subdivisions in chip documentation such as "internal"<BR>&nbsp; or "external" interrupts.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Access to non-SRC interrupts is not implemented through IRQ routing mechanisms.
