<P>XICS interrupt controller</P>
<P></P>
<P>Device type supported: KVM_DEV_TYPE_XICS</P>
<P>Groups:<BR>&nbsp; KVM_DEV_XICS_SOURCES<BR>&nbsp; Attributes: One per interrupt source, indexed by the source number.</P>
<P>This device emulates the XICS (eXternal Interrupt Controller<BR>Specification) defined in PAPR.&nbsp; The XICS has a set of interrupt<BR>sources, each identified by a 20-bit source number, and a set of<BR>Interrupt Control Presentation (ICP) entities, also called "servers",<BR>each associated with a virtual CPU.</P>
<P>The ICP entities are created by enabling the KVM_CAP_IRQ_ARCH<BR>capability for each vcpu, specifying KVM_CAP_IRQ_XICS in args[0] and<BR>the interrupt server number (i.e. the vcpu number from the XICS's<BR>point of view) in args[1] of the kvm_enable_cap struct.&nbsp; Each ICP has<BR>64 bits of state which can be read and written using the<BR>KVM_GET_ONE_REG and KVM_SET_ONE_REG ioctls on the vcpu.&nbsp; The 64 bit<BR>state word has the following bitfields, starting at the<BR>least-significant end of the word:</P>
<P>* Unused, 16 bits</P>
<P>* Pending interrupt priority, 8 bits<BR>&nbsp; Zero is the highest priority, 255 means no interrupt is pending.</P>
<P>* Pending IPI (inter-processor interrupt) priority, 8 bits<BR>&nbsp; Zero is the highest priority, 255 means no IPI is pending.</P>
<P>* Pending interrupt source number, 24 bits<BR>&nbsp; Zero means no interrupt pending, 2 means an IPI is pending</P>
<P>* Current processor priority, 8 bits<BR>&nbsp; Zero is the highest priority, meaning no interrupts can be<BR>&nbsp; delivered, and 255 is the lowest priority.</P>
<P>Each source has 64 bits of state that can be read and written using<BR>the KVM_GET_DEVICE_ATTR and KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR ioctls, specifying the<BR>KVM_DEV_XICS_SOURCES attribute group, with the attribute number being<BR>the interrupt source number.&nbsp; The 64 bit state word has the following<BR>bitfields, starting from the least-significant end of the word:</P>
<P>* Destination (server number), 32 bits<BR>&nbsp; This specifies where the interrupt should be sent, and is the<BR>&nbsp; interrupt server number specified for the destination vcpu.</P>
<P>* Priority, 8 bits<BR>&nbsp; This is the priority specified for this interrupt source, where 0 is<BR>&nbsp; the highest priority and 255 is the lowest.&nbsp; An interrupt with a<BR>&nbsp; priority of 255 will never be delivered.</P>
<P>* Level sensitive flag, 1 bit<BR>&nbsp; This bit is 1 for a level-sensitive interrupt source, or 0 for<BR>&nbsp; edge-sensitive (or MSI).</P>
<P>* Masked flag, 1 bit<BR>&nbsp; This bit is set to 1 if the interrupt is masked (cannot be delivered<BR>&nbsp; regardless of its priority), for example by the ibm,int-off RTAS<BR>&nbsp; call, or 0 if it is not masked.</P>
<P>* Pending flag, 1 bit<BR>&nbsp; This bit is 1 if the source has a pending interrupt, otherwise 0.</P>
<P>Only one XICS instance may be created per VM.
