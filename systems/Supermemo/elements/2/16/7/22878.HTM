# Documentation/sysctl/README
<P></P>
<P>Documentation for /proc/sys/&nbsp;&nbsp;kernel version 2.2.10<BR>&nbsp;(c) 1998, 1999,&nbsp; Rik van Riel &lt;<A href="mailto:riel@nl.linux.org">riel@nl.linux.org</A>&gt;</P>

<P>'Why', I hear you ask, 'would anyone even _want_ documentation<BR>for them sysctl files? If anybody really needs it, it's all in<BR>the source...'</P>
<P>Well, this documentation is written because some people either<BR>don't know they need to tweak something, or because they don't<BR>have the time or knowledge to read the source code.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the programmers who built sysctl have built it to<BR>be actually used, not just for the fun of programming it :-)</P>
<P>==============================================================</P>
<P>Legal blurb:</P>
<P>As usual, there are two main things to consider:<BR>1. you get what you pay for<BR>2. it's free</P>
<P>The consequences are that I won't guarantee the correctness of<BR>this document, and if you come to me complaining about how you<BR>screwed up your system because of wrong documentation, I won't<BR>feel sorry for you. I might even laugh at you...</P>
<P>But of course, if you _do_ manage to screw up your system using<BR>only the sysctl options used in this file, I'd like to hear of<BR>it. Not only to have a great laugh, but also to make sure that<BR>you're the last RTFMing person to screw up.</P>
<P>In short, e-mail your suggestions, corrections and / or horror<BR>stories to: &lt;<A href="mailto:riel@nl.linux.org">riel@nl.linux.org</A>&gt;</P>

<P>Introduction:</P>
<P>Sysctl is a means of configuring certain aspects of the kernel<BR>at run-time, and the /proc/sys/ directory is there so that you<BR>don't even need special tools to do it!<BR>In fact, there are only four things needed to use these config<BR>facilities:<BR>- a running Linux system<BR>- root access<BR>- common sense (this is especially hard to come by these days)<BR>- knowledge of what all those values mean</P>
<P>As a quick 'ls /proc/sys' will show, the directory consists of<BR>several (arch-dependent?) subdirs. Each subdir is mainly about<BR>one part of the kernel, so you can do configuration on a piece<BR>by piece basis, or just some 'thematic frobbing'.</P>
<P>The subdirs are about:<BR>abi/&nbsp;&nbsp;execution domains &amp; personalities<BR>debug/&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;empty&gt;<BR>dev/&nbsp;&nbsp;device specific information (eg dev/cdrom/info)<BR>fs/&nbsp;&nbsp;specific filesystems<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;filehandle, inode, dentry and quota tuning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;binfmt_misc &lt;Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt&gt;<BR>kernel/&nbsp;&nbsp;global kernel info / tuning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;miscellaneous stuff<BR>net/&nbsp;&nbsp;networking stuff, for documentation look in:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Documentation/networking/&gt;<BR>proc/&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;empty&gt;<BR>sunrpc/&nbsp;&nbsp;SUN Remote Procedure Call (NFS)<BR>vm/&nbsp;&nbsp;memory management tuning<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;buffer and cache management</P>
<P>These are the subdirs I have on my system. There might be more<BR>or other subdirs in another setup. If you see another dir, I'd<BR>really like to hear about it :-)
