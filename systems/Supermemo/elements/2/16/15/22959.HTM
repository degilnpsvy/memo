A. Configuration 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;The framebuffer console can be enabled by using your favorite kernel<BR>configuration tool.&nbsp; It is under Device Drivers-&gt;Graphics Support-&gt;Support for<BR>framebuffer devices-&gt;Framebuffer Console Support.</FONT> Select 'y' to compile<BR>support statically, or 'm' for module support.&nbsp; The module will be fbcon.</P>
<P>&nbsp;In order for fbcon to activate, at least one framebuffer driver is<BR>required, so choose from any of the numerous drivers available. For x86<BR>systems, they almost universally have VGA cards, so vga16fb and vesafb will<BR>always be available. However, using a chipset-specific driver will give you<BR>more speed and features, such as the ability to change the video mode<BR>dynamically.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;To display the penguin logo, choose any logo available in Logo<BR>Configuration-&gt;Boot up logo.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;Also, you will need to select at least one compiled-in fonts, but if<BR>you don't do anything, the kernel configuration tool will select one for you,<BR>usually an 8x16 font.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>GOTCHA: A common bug report is enabling the framebuffer without enabling the<BR>framebuffer console.&nbsp; Depending on the driver, you may get a blanked or<BR>garbled display, but the system still boots to completion.&nbsp; If you are<BR>fortunate to have a driver that does not alter the graphics chip, then you<BR>will still get a VGA console.</FONT>
