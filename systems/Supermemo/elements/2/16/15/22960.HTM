B. Loading 
<P></P>
<P>Possible scenarios:</P>
<P>1. Driver and fbcon are compiled statically</P>
<P>&nbsp; Usually, fbcon will automatically take over your console. The notable<BR>&nbsp; exception is vesafb.&nbsp; It needs to be explicitly activated with the<BR>&nbsp; vga= boot option parameter.</P>
<P>2. Driver is compiled statically, fbcon is compiled as a module</P>
<P>&nbsp; Depending on the driver, you either get a standard console, or a<BR>&nbsp; garbled display, as mentioned above.&nbsp; To get a framebuffer console,<BR>&nbsp; do a 'modprobe fbcon'.</P>
<P>3. Driver is compiled as a module, fbcon is compiled statically</P>
<P>&nbsp; You get your standard console.&nbsp; Once the driver is loaded with<BR>&nbsp; 'modprobe xxxfb', fbcon automatically takes over the console with<BR>&nbsp; the possible exception of using the fbcon=map:n option. See below.</P>
<P>4. Driver and fbcon are compiled as a module.</P>
<P>&nbsp; You can load them in any order. Once both are loaded, fbcon will take<BR>&nbsp; over the console.
