<P></P>
<P>There are a lot of kinds of objects in the kernel that don't have<BR>individual limits or that have limits that are ineffective when a set<BR>of processes is allowed to switch user ids.&nbsp; With user namespaces<BR>enabled in a kernel for people who don't trust their users or their<BR>users programs to play nice this problems becomes more acute.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Therefore it is recommended that memory control groups be enabled in<BR>kernels that enable user namespaces, and it is further recommended<BR>that userspace configure memory control groups to limit how much<BR>memory user's they don't trust to play nice can use.</P>
<P>Memory control groups can be configured by installing the libcgroup<BR>package present on most distros editing /etc/cgrules.conf,<BR>/etc/cgconfig.conf and setting up libpam-cgroup.
