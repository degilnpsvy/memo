4. The X Server<BR>--------------- 
<P></P>
<P>The X server (XF68_FBDev) is the most notable application program for the frame<BR>buffer device. Starting with XFree86 release 3.2, the X server is part of<BR>XFree86 and has 2 modes:</P>
<P>&nbsp; - If the `Display' subsection for the `fbdev' driver in the /etc/XF86Config<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file contains a</P>
<P>&nbsp;Modes "default"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; line, the X server will use the scheme discussed above, i.e. it will start<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up in the resolution determined by /dev/fb0 (or $FRAMEBUFFER, if set). You<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; still have to specify the color depth (using the Depth keyword) and virtual<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolution (using the Virtual keyword) though. This is the default for the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; configuration file supplied with XFree86. It's the most simple<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; configuration, but it has some limitations.</P>
<P>&nbsp; - Therefore it's also possible to specify resolutions in the /etc/XF86Config<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file. This allows for on-the-fly resolution switching while retaining the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same virtual desktop size. The frame buffer device that's used is still<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /dev/fb0current (or $FRAMEBUFFER), but the available resolutions are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defined by /etc/XF86Config now. The disadvantage is that you have to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specify the timings in a different format (but `fbset -x' may help).</P>
<P>To tune a video mode, you can use fbset or xvidtune. Note that xvidtune doesn't<BR>work 100% with XF68_FBDev: the reported clock values are always incorrect.
