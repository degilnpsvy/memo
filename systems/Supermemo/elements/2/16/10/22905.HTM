Another situation where one might be tempted to use volatile is<BR>when the processor is busy-waiting on the value of a variable.&nbsp; The right<BR>way to perform a busy wait is:
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (my_variable != what_i_want)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cpu_relax();</P>
<P>The cpu_relax() call can lower CPU power consumption or yield to a<BR>hyperthreaded twin processor; it also happens to serve as a compiler<BR>barrier, so, once again, volatile is unnecessary.&nbsp; Of course, busy-<BR>waiting is generally an anti-social act to begin with.
