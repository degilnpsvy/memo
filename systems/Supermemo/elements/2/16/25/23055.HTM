<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>The 1-Wire Bus</H3>
<P class=docText><A name=The></A>The <SPAN class=docEmphasis>1-wire protocol</SPAN><A name="uses a"></A> developed by Dallas/Maxim uses a 1-wire (or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>w1</SPAN><A name="that carries"></A>) bus that carries both power and signal; the return ground path is provided using some other means. It provides a simple way to interface with slow devices by reducing space, cost, and complexity. An example device that works using this protocol is the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ibutton</SPAN> (<A class=docLink href="http://www.ibutton.com/" target=_blank>www.ibutton.com</A>), which is used for sensing temperature, carrying data, or holding unique IDs.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of an"></A>Another w1 chip that interfaces through a single port pin of an embedded controller is the DS2433 4kb 1-wire EEPROM from Dallas/Maxim. The driver for this chip, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/w1/slaves/w1_ds2433.c</SPAN><A name="via a"></A>, exports access to the EEPROM via a sysfs node.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=are></A>The main data structures associated with a w1 device driver are <TT>w1_family</TT> and <TT>w1_family_ops</TT>, both defined in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>w1_family.h</SPAN>.
