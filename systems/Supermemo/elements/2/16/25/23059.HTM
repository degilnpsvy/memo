<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>What's PCMCIA/CF?</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="used by"></A>PCMCIA is a 16-bit data-transfer interface specification originally used by memory cards. CF cards are smaller, but compatible with PCMCIA, and are frequently used in handheld devices such as PDAs and digital cameras. CF cards have only 50 pins but can be slipped into your laptop's 68-pin PCMCIA slot using a passive CF-to-PCMCIA adapter. PCMCIA and CF have been confined to the laptop and handheld space and have not made inroads into desktops and higher-end machines.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="support for"></A>The PCMCIA specification has now grown to include support for higher speeds in the form of 32-bit <SPAN class=docEmphasis>CardBus</SPAN><A name=term></A> cards. The term <SPAN class=docEmphasis>PC Card</SPAN><A name="is closer"></A> is used while referring to either PCMCIA or CardBus devices. CardBus is closer to the PCI bus, so the kernel has moved support for CardBus devices from the PCMCIA layer to the PCI layer. The latest technology specification from the PCMCIA industry standards group is the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>ExpressCard</SPAN><A name="which is"></A>, which is compatible with <SPAN class=docEmphasis>PCI Express</SPAN><A name="bus technology"></A>, a new bus technology based on PCI concepts. We look at CardBus and ExpressCard when we discuss PCI in the next chapter.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="cards come"></A>PC cards come in three flavors in the increasing order of thickness: Type I (3.3mm), Type II (5mm), and Type III (10.5mm).</P>

As you might have noticed, the PCMCIA host controller bridges the PCMCIA card with the system bus. Laptops and their derivatives generally have a PCMCIA host controller chip connected to the PCI bus, while several embedded controllers have a PCMCIA host controller built in to their silicon. The controller maps card memory to host I/O and memory windows and routes interrupts generated by the card to a suitable processor interrupt line.</P><A name=ch09fig01></A>
