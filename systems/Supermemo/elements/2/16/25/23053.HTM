<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>Hardware Monitoring Using LM-Sensors</H3>
<P class=docText><A name=The></A>The <SPAN class=docEmphasis>LM-Sensors</SPAN> project, hosted at <A class=docLink href="http://www.lm-sensors.org/" target=_blank>www.lm-sensors.org</A><A name="to Linux"></A>, brings hardware-monitoring capabilities to Linux. Several computer systems use sensor chips to monitor parameters such as temperature, power supply voltage, and fan speed. Periodically tracking these parameters can be critical. A blown CPU fan can manifest in the form of strange and random software problems. Imagine the consequences if the system is a medical grade device!</P>
<P class=docText><A name="to the"></A>LM-Sensors comes to the rescue with device drivers for many sensor chips, a utility called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>sensors</SPAN> to generate a health report, and a script called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>sensors-detect</SPAN><A name="configuration files"></A> to scan your system and help you generate appropriate configuration files.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="monitoring interface"></A>Most chips that offer hardware monitoring interface to the CPU via I<SUP>2</SUP>C/SMBus. Device drivers for such devices are normal I<SUP>2</SUP>C client drivers but reside in the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/hwmon/</SPAN> directory, rather than <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/i2c/chips/</SPAN><A name="Have a"></A>. An example is National Semiconductor's LM87 chip, which can monitor multiple voltages, temperatures, and fans. Have a look at <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/hwmon/lm87.c</SPAN> for its driver implementation. I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="reserved for"></A>C driver IDs from 1000 to 1999 are reserved for sensor chips (look at <SPAN class=docEmphasis>include/linux/i2c-id.h</SPAN>).</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the ISA"></A>Several sensor chips interface to the CPU via the ISA/LPC bus rather than I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="emit analog"></A>C/SMBus. Others emit analog output that reaches the CPU through an <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Analog-to-Digital Converter</SPAN> (ADC). Drivers for such chips share the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/hwmon/</SPAN> directory with I<SUP>2</SUP>C sensor drivers. An example of a non-I<SUP>2</SUP>C sensor driver is <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/hwmon/hdaps.c</SPAN><A name="we discussed"></A>, the driver for the accelerometer present in several IBM/Lenovo laptops that we discussed in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</A><A name="Another example"></A>, "Input Drivers." Another example of a non-I<SUP>2</SUP><A name="is the"></A>C sensor is the Winbond 83627HF Super I/O chip, which is driven by <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/hwmon/w83627hf.c</SPAN>.
