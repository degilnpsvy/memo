<P class=docText><A name="addition to"></A>In addition to released kernels, kernel.org also hosts a set of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>patches</SPAN><A name="for future"></A> maintained by front-line developers that serve as a test bed for future stable releases. A patch is a text file containing source code differences between a development tree and the original snapshot from which the developer started work. A popular patch-set available at kernel.org is the <TT>-mm</TT><A name="the lead"></A> patch periodically released by Andrew Morton, the lead maintainer of the Linux kernel. You will find experimental features in the <TT>-mm</TT><A name="mainline source"></A> patch that have not yet made it to the mainline source tree. Another patch-set periodically released on kernel.org is the <TT>&#37413;&#25617;t</TT> (real time) patch maintained by Ingo Molnar. Several <TT>&#37413;&#25617;t</TT><A name="mainline kernel"></A> features have been merged into the mainline kernel.
