<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>Linux Distributions</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="Because a"></A>Because a GNU/Linux system consists of numerous utilities, programs, libraries, and tools, in addition to the kernel, it's a daunting task to acquire and correctly install all the pieces. Linux distributions come to the rescue by classifying the components and bundling them into packages in an orderly fashion. A typical distribution contains thousands of ready-made packages. You need not worry about downloading the right program versions or fixing dependency issues.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="is a"></A>Because packaging is a way to make a lot of money within the ambit of the GNU license, there are several Linux distributions in the market today. Distributions such as Red Hat/Fedora, Debian, SuSE, Slackware, Gentoo, Ubuntu, and Mandriva are primarily meant for the desktop user. MontaVista, TimeSys, and Wind River distributions are geared toward embedded development. Embedded Linux distributions also include a dynamically configurable compact application-set to tailor the system's footprint to suit resource constraints.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="addition to"></A>In addition to packaging, distributions offer value-adds for kernel development. Many projects start development based on kernels supplied by a distribution rather than a kernel released officially at kernel.org. Reasons for this include the following:</P>

<P class=docList><A name="mainline kernel"></A>The mainline kernel might not include full support for the embedded controller of your choice even if the controller is built around a kernel-supported CPU core. A Linux distribution might offer device drivers for all the peripheral modules inside the controller, however.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList><A name="may not"></A>Debugging tools that you plan to use during kernel development may not be part of the mainline kernel. For example, the kernel has no built-in debugger support. If you want to use a kernel debugger during development, you have to separately download and apply the corresponding patches. You have to endure more hassles if tested patches are not readily available for your kernel version. Distributions prepackage many useful debugging features, so you can start using them right away.</P>
