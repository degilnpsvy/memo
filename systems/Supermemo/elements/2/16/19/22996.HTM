<P class=docText><A name="student named"></A>Linux started as the hobby of a Finnish college student named Linus Torvalds in 1991, but quickly metamorphed into an advanced operating system popular all over the planet. From its first release for the Intel 386 processor, the kernel has gradually grown in complexity to support numerous architectures, multiprocessor hardware, and high-performance clusters. The full list of supported CPUs is long, but some of the major supported architectures are x86, IA64, ARM, PowerPC, Alpha, s390, MIPS, and SPARC. Linux has been ported to hundreds of hardware platforms built around these processors. The kernel is continuously getting better, and the evolution is progressing at a frantic pace.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="a desktop"></A>Although it started life as a desktop-operating system, Linux has penetrated the embedded and enterprise worlds and is touching our daily lives. When you push the buttons on your handheld, flip your remote to the weather channel, or visit the hospital for a physical checkup, it's increasingly likely that some Linux code is being set into motion to come to your service. Linux's free availability is helping its evolution as much as its technical superiority. Whether it's an initiative to develop sub-$100 computers to enable the world's poor or pricing pressure in the consumer electronics space, Linux is today's operating system of choice, <A name=iddle1618></A><A name=iddle2150></A><A name=iddle2153></A><A name=iddle2154></A><A name=iddle2158></A><A name=iddle2734></A><A name=iddle3686></A><A name="desired price"></A>because proprietary operating systems sometimes cost more than the desired price of the computers themselves.
