<P class=docText><A name=The></A><FONT class=extract>The <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="Mailing List"></A>Linux Kernel Mailing List</SPAN></FONT><A name="the forum"></A><FONT class=extract> (LKML) is the forum where developers debate on design issues and decide on future features. You can find a real-time feed of the mailing list at </FONT><A class=docLink href="http://www.lkml.org/" target=_blank><FONT class=extract>www.lkml.org</FONT></A><A name="contributed by"></A><FONT class=extract>. The kernel now contains several million lines of code contributed by thousands of developers all over the world. LKML acts as the thread that ties all these developers together.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><A name="Linux questions"></A>LKML is not for general Linux questions. The basic rule is to post only questions pertaining to kernel development that have not been previously answered in the mailing list or in popularly available documentation. If the C compiler crashed while compiling your Linux application, you should post that question elsewhere.</P>
<P class=docText><A name=a></A>Discussions in some LKML threads are more interesting than a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>New York Times</SPAN><A name="archives to"></A> bestseller. Spend a few hours browsing LKML archives to get an insight into the philosophy behind the Linux kernel.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="specific mailing"></A>Most subprojects in the kernel have their own specific mailing lists. So, subscribe to the linux-mtd mailing list if you are developing a Linux flash memory driver or initiate a thread in the linux-usb-devel mailing list if you think you have found a bug in the USB mass storage driver. We refer to relevant mailing lists at the end of several chapters.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="various forums"></A>In various forums, kernel experts from around the globe gather under one roof. The <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Linux Symposium</SPAN> held annually at Ottawa, Canada, is one such conference. Others include the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Linux Kongress</SPAN> that takes place in Germany and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>linux.conf.au</SPAN> organized <A name=iddle1387></A><A name=iddle1593></A><A name=iddle1814></A><A name=iddle2645></A><A name=iddle2783></A><A name=iddle2805></A><A name=iddle2877></A><A name=iddle4001></A><A name=iddle4109></A><A name="leaders meet"></A>in Australia. There are also numerous commercial Linux forums where industry leaders meet and share their insights. An example is the <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="LinuxWorld Conference"></A>LinuxWorld Conference and Expo</SPAN><A name="in North"></A> held yearly in North America.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the latest"></A><FONT class=extract>For the latest news from the developer community, check out </FONT><A class=docLink href="http://lwn.net/" target=_blank><FONT class=extract>http://lwn.net/</FONT></A><A name="latest kernel"></A><FONT class=extract>. If you want to glean the highlights of the latest kernel release without many cryptic references to kernel internals, this might be a good place to look.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>You can find another web community that discusses current kernel topics at </FONT><A class=docLink href="http://kerneltrap.org/" target=_blank><FONT class=extract>http://kerneltrap.org/</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><A name="will see"></A>With every major kernel release, you will see sweeping improvements, be it kernel preemption, lock-free readers, new services to offload work from interrupt handlers, or support for new architectures. Stay in constant touch with the mailing lists, websites, and forums, to keep yourself in the thick of things.
