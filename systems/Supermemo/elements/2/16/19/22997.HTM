<H3 id=-100000 class=docSection1Title>The GNU Copyleft</H3>
<P class=docText><A name="The GNU"></A>The GNU project (GNU is a recursive acronym for <SPAN class=docEmphasis>GNU's Not UNIX</SPAN><A name="and was"></A>) predates Linux and was launched to develop a free UNIX-like operating system. A complete GNU operating system is powered by the Linux kernel but also contains components such as libraries, compilers, and utilities. A Linux-based computer is hence more accurately a GNU/Linux system. All components of a GNU/Linux system are built using free software.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="are different"></A>There are different flavors of free software. One such flavor is called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>public domain</SPAN><A name="no restrictions"></A> software. Software released under the public domain is not copyrighted, and no restrictions are imposed on its usage. You can use it for free, make changes to it, and even restrict the distribution of your modified sources. As you can see, the "no restrictions" clause introduces the power to introduce restrictions downstream.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="sponsor of"></A>The Free Software Foundation, the primary sponsor of the GNU project, created the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>GNU Public License</SPAN> (GPL), also called a <SPAN class=docEmphasis>copyleft</SPAN><A name="into proprietary"></A>, to prevent the possibility of middlemen transforming free software into proprietary software. Those who modify copylefted software are required to also copyleft their derived work. The Linux kernel and most components of a GNU system such as the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>GNU Compiler Collection</SPAN><A name="make modifications"></A> (GCC) are released under the GPL. So, if you make modifications to the kernel, you have to return your changes back to the community. Essentially, you have to pass on the rights vested on you by the copyleft.</P><A name=ch01note01></A>

<P class=docText><A name="There is"></A>The Linux kernel is licensed under GPL version 2. There is an ongoing debate in the kernel community about whether the kernel should move to GPLv3, the latest version of the GPL. The current tide seems to be against relicensing the kernel to adopt GPLv3.</P>
<P></P></DIV><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="applications that"></A>Linux applications that invoke system calls to access kernel services are not considered derived work, however, and won't be restricted by the GPL. Similarly, libraries are covered by a less-stringent license called the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>GNU Lesser General Public License</SPAN><A name="under the"></A> (LGPL). Proprietary software is permitted to dynamically link with libraries released under the LGPL.
