The data you see when you browse procfs is generated by the kernel on-the-fly. Files in procfs are used to configure kernel parameters, look at kernel structures, glean statistics from device drivers, and get general system information.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="is a"></A>Procfs is a pseudo filesystem. This means that files resident in procfs are not associated with physical storage devices such as hard disks. Instead, data in those files is dynamically created on demand by the corresponding entry points in the kernel. Because of this, file sizes in procfs get shown as zero. Procfs is usually mounted under the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc</SPAN><A name=the></A> directory during kernel boot; you can see this by invoking the <TT>mount</TT> command.</P>
<P class=docText><A name="of the"></A>To get a first feel of the capabilities of procfs, examine the contents of <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/cpuinfo</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/meminfo</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/interrupts</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/tty/driver/serial</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/bus/usb/devices</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/stat.</SPAN><A name="writing to"></A> <FONT class=extract>Certain kernel parameters can be changed at runtime by writing to files under <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/sys/</SPAN>.</FONT> For example, you can change kernel <TT>printk</TT><A name="set of"></A> log levels by echoing a new set of values to <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc/sys/kernel/printk</SPAN><A name="as sysstat"></A>. <FONT class=extract>Many utilities (such as ps) and system performance monitoring tools (such as sysstat) internally derive information from files residing under <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/proc</SPAN>.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphasis>Seq files</SPAN><A name="in the"></A>, introduced in the 2.6 kernel, simplify large procfs operations. They are described in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/app03.html#app03">Appendix C</A>, "Seq Files."
