The memory system can respond by taking actions that are expected to speed up the memory accesses when they do occur, such as pre-loading the cache line containing the specified address into the instruction cache. For more information see Preloading caches on page A3-121 and Memory hints on page A7-215</FONT>.</FONT></SPAN>
