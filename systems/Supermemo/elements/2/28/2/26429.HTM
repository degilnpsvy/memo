The memory system can respond by taking actions that are expected to speed up the memory accesses when they do occur, such as pre-loading the cache line containing the specified address into the instruction cache. See Preloading caches on page A3-121 and Memory hints on page A7-215 for additional information</FONT>.</FONT></SPAN>
