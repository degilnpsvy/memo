<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><FONT face=Calibri><FONT class=clozed>Multiply multiplies two register values. The least significant 32 bits of the result are written to the destination register. These 32 bits do not depend on whether signed or unsigned calculations are performed. It can optionally update the condition flags based on the result. This option is limited to only a few forms of the instruction in the Thumb instruction set, and use of it will adversely affect performance on many processor implementations</FONT>.</FONT></SPAN>
