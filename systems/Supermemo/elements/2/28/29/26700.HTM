Almost all classes show up in sysfs under <FONT class=clozed>/sys/class. Thus, for example, all network interfaces can be found under /sys/class/net, regardless of the type of interface. Input devices can be found in /sys/class/input, and serial devices are in /sys/class/tty. The one exception is block devices, which can be found under /sys/block for historical reasons.</FONT></FONT>
