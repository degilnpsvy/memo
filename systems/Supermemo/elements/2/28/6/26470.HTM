<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt"><FONT face=Calibri><FONT class=clozed>Signed Multiply Accumulate Long (halfwords) multiplies two signed 16-bit values to produce a 32-bit value, and accumulates this with a 64-bit value. The multiply acts on two signed 16-bit quantities, taken from either the bottom or the top half of their respective source registers. The other halves of these source registers are ignored. The 32-bit product is sign-extended and accumulated with a 64-bit accumulate value. Overflow is possible during this instruction, but only as a result of the 64-bit addition. This overflow is not detected if it occurs. Instead, the result wraps around modulo 264</FONT>.</FONT></SPAN>
