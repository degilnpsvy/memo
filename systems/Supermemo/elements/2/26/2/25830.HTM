&nbsp; * The scheduler considers a CPU idle if it doesn't have any task<BR>&nbsp; * to execute and tries to keep idle cores idle to conserve power;<BR>&nbsp; * however, for example, a <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> on an idle CPU will force the scheduler to<BR>&nbsp; * excute the work item on that CPU breaking the idleness, which in<BR>&nbsp; * turn may lead to more scheduling choices which are sub-optimal<BR>&nbsp; * in terms of power consumption.
