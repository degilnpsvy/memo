Before making any actual modifications to the Linux kernel code, it is<BR>imperative to understand how the code in question works.&nbsp; For this<BR>purpose, nothing is better than reading through it directly (most tricky<BR>bits are commented well), perhaps even with the help of specialized<BR>tools.&nbsp; One such tool that is particularly recommended is the Linux<BR>Cross-Reference project, which is able to present source code in a<BR>self-referential, indexed webpage format. An excellent up-to-date<BR>repository of the kernel code may be found at:<BR>&nbsp;<A href="http://lxr.linux.no/+trees">http://lxr.linux.no/+trees</A>
