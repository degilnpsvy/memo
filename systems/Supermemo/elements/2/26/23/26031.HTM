Here is a list of files that are in the kernel source tree that are<BR>required reading:<BR>&nbsp; README<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file gives a short background on the Linux kernel and describes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is necessary to do to configure and build the kernel.&nbsp; People<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who are new to the kernel should start here.
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/Changes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file gives a list of the minimum levels of various software<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; packages that are necessary to build and run the kernel<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; successfully.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/CodingStyle<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This describes the Linux kernel coding style, and some of the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rationale behind it. All new code is expected to follow the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; guidelines in this document. Most maintainers will only accept<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; patches if these rules are followed, and many people will only<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; review code if it is in the proper style.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/SubmittingPatches<BR>&nbsp; Documentation/SubmittingDrivers<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These files describe in explicit detail how to successfully create<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and send a patch, including (but not limited to):<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Email contents<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Email format<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Who to send it to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following these rules will not guarantee success (as all patches are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to scrutiny for content and style), but not following them<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will almost always prevent it.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other excellent descriptions of how to create patches properly are:<BR>&nbsp;"The Perfect Patch"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A href="http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/stuff/tpp.txt">http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/stuff/tpp.txt</A><BR>&nbsp;"Linux kernel patch submission format"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A href="http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html">http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html</A></P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file describes the rationale behind the conscious decision to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not have a stable API within the kernel, including things like:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Subsystem shim-layers (for compatibility?)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Driver portability between Operating Systems.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mitigating rapid change within the kernel source tree (or<BR>&nbsp;preventing rapid change)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document is crucial for understanding the Linux development<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; philosophy and is very important for people moving to Linux from<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development on other Operating Systems.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/SecurityBugs<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you feel you have found a security problem in the Linux kernel,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; please follow the steps in this document to help notify the kernel<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developers, and help solve the issue.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/ManagementStyle<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document describes how Linux kernel maintainers operate and the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shared ethos behind their methodologies.&nbsp; This is important reading<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for anyone new to kernel development (or anyone simply curious about<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it), as it resolves a lot of common misconceptions and confusion<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about the unique behavior of kernel maintainers.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file describes the rules on how the stable kernel releases<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; happen, and what to do if you want to get a change into one of these<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; releases.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/kernel-docs.txt<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of external documentation that pertains to kernel<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; development.&nbsp; Please consult this list if you do not find what you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are looking for within the in-kernel documentation.</P>
<P>&nbsp; Documentation/applying-patches.txt<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A good introduction describing exactly what a patch is and how to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apply it to the different development branches of the kernel.
