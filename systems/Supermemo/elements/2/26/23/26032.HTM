If you do not know anything about Linux kernel development, you should<BR>look at the Linux KernelNewbies project:<BR>&nbsp;<A href="http://kernelnewbies.org">http://kernelnewbies.org</A><BR>It consists of a helpful mailing list where you can ask almost any type<BR>of basic kernel development question (make sure to search the archives<BR>first, before asking something that has already been answered in the<BR>past.)&nbsp; It also has an IRC channel that you can use to ask questions in<BR>real-time, and a lot of helpful documentation that is useful for<BR>learning about Linux kernel development.

<P>The website has basic information about code organization, subsystems,<BR>and current projects (both in-tree and out-of-tree). It also describes<BR>some basic logistical information, like how to compile a kernel and<BR>apply a patch.
