If you do not know where you want to start, but you want to look for<BR>some task to start doing to join into the kernel development community,<BR>go to the Linux Kernel Janitor's project:<BR>&nbsp;<A href="http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelJanitors">http://kernelnewbies.org/KernelJanitors</A>&nbsp;<BR>It is a great place to start.&nbsp; It describes a list of relatively simple<BR>problems that need to be cleaned up and fixed within the Linux kernel<BR>source tree.&nbsp; Working with the developers in charge of this project, you<BR>will learn the basics of getting your patch into the Linux kernel tree,<BR>and possibly be pointed in the direction of what to go work on next, if<BR>you do not already have an idea.
