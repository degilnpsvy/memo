&nbsp;* Do not call this routine or device_register() more than once for<BR>&nbsp;* any device structure.&nbsp; The driver model core is not designed to work<BR>&nbsp;* with devices that get unregistered and then spring back to life.<BR>&nbsp;* (Among other things, it's very hard to guarantee that all references<BR>&nbsp;* to the previous incarnation of @dev have been dropped.)&nbsp; Allocate<BR>&nbsp;* and register a fresh new struct device instead.
