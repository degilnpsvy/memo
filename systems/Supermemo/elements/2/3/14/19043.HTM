One bad habit beginning programmers have using abritary numbers instead of symbolic constants. For example they'll have 1 mean main menu, 2 mean options, etc which is fine for small programs. When you're dealing with thousands of lines of code (which video games usually do), having a line that says "if( option == 1 )" will produce much more headaches than using "if( option == MAIN_MENU )".</SPAN>
