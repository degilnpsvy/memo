<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#arch/x86/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;archclean:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$(Q)$(MAKE) $(clean)=arch/x86/boot</P>
<P>When "make clean" is executed, make will descend down in arch/x86/boot,<BR>and clean as usual. The Makefile located in arch/x86/boot/ may use<BR>the subdir- trick to descend further down.
