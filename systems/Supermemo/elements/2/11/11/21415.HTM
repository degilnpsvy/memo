- If you compiled the kernel with CONFIG_KALLSYMS you can send the dump<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; as is, otherwise you will have to use the "ksymoops" program to make<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; sense of the dump (but compiling with CONFIG_KALLSYMS is usually preferred).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This utility can be downloaded from<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <A href="ftp://ftp.<country>.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops/">ftp://ftp.&lt;country&gt;.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops/</A> .<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, you can do the dump lookup by hand:
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;- In debugging dumps like the above, it helps enormously if you can<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; look up what the EIP value means.&nbsp; The hex value as such doesn't help<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; me or anybody else very much: it will depend on your particular<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel setup.&nbsp; What you should do is take the hex value from the EIP<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; line (ignore the "0010:"), and look it up in the kernel namelist to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; see which kernel function contains the offending address.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To find out the kernel function name, you'll need to find the system<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; binary associated with the kernel that exhibited the symptom.&nbsp; This is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the file 'linux/vmlinux'.&nbsp; To extract the namelist and match it against<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the EIP from the kernel crash, do:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nm vmlinux | sort | less</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This will give you a list of kernel addresses sorted in ascending<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; order, from which it is simple to find the function that contains the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; offending address.&nbsp; Note that the address given by the kernel<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; debugging messages will not necessarily match exactly with the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; function addresses (in fact, that is very unlikely), so you can't<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; just 'grep' the list: the list will, however, give you the starting<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; point of each kernel function, so by looking for the function that<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; has a starting address lower than the one you are searching for but<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; is followed by a function with a higher address you will find the one<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; you want.&nbsp; In fact, it may be a good idea to include a bit of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "context" in your problem report, giving a few lines around the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting one. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you for some reason cannot do the above (you have a pre-compiled<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel image or similar), telling me as much about your setup as<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; possible will help.&nbsp; Please read the REPORTING-BUGS document for details.
