&nbsp;- Alternatively, you can use gdb on a running kernel. (read-only; i.e. you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot change values or set break points.) To do this, first compile the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel with -g; edit arch/i386/Makefile appropriately, then do a "make<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; clean". You'll also need to enable CONFIG_PROC_FS (via "make config").</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After you've rebooted with the new kernel, do "gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; You can now use all the usual gdb commands. The command to look up the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; point where your system crashed is "l *0xXXXXXXXX". (Replace the XXXes<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; with the EIP value.)</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; gdb'ing a non-running kernel currently fails because gdb (wrongly)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; disregards the starting offset for which the kernel is compiled.
