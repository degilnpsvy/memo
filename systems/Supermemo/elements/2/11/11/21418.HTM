# We are using a recursive build, so we need to do a little thinking<BR># to get the ordering right.<BR>#<BR># Most importantly: sub-Makefiles should only ever modify files in<BR># their own directory. If in some directory we have a dependency on<BR># a file in another dir (which doesn't happen often, but it's often<BR># unavoidable when linking the built-in.o targets which finally<BR># turn into vmlinux), we will <FONT class=clozed>call a sub make in that other dir, and<BR># after that we are sure that everything which is in that other dir<BR># is now up to date.</FONT><BR>#<BR># The only cases where we need to modify files which have global<BR># effects are thus separated out and done before the recursive<BR># descending is started. They are now explicitly listed as the<BR># prepare rule.
