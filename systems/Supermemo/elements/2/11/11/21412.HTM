&nbsp;- NOTES on "make config": 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Having unnecessary drivers will make the kernel bigger, and can<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under some circumstances lead to problems: probing for a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nonexistent controller card may confuse your other controllers</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Compiling the kernel with "Processor type" set higher than 386<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will result in a kernel that does NOT work on a 386.&nbsp; The<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel will detect this on bootup, and give up.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - A kernel with math-emulation compiled in will still use the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coprocessor if one is present: the math emulation will just<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; never get used in that case.&nbsp; The kernel will be slightly larger,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but will work on different machines regardless of whether they<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have a math coprocessor or not.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The "kernel hacking" configuration details usually result in a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bigger or slower kernel (or both), and can even make the kernel<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less stable by configuring some routines to actively try to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break bad code to find kernel problems (kmalloc()).&nbsp; Thus you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should probably answer 'n' to the questions for "development",<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "experimental", or "debugging" features.</FONT>
