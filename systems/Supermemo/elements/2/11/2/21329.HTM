&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if_changed
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;if_changed is the infrastructure used for the following commands.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Usage:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;target: source(s) FORCE<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$(call if_changed,ld/objcopy/gzip)</P>
<P>&nbsp;When the rule is evaluated, it is checked to see if any files<BR>&nbsp;need an update, or the command line has changed since the last<BR>&nbsp;invocation. The latter will force a rebuild if any options<BR>&nbsp;to the executable have changed.<BR>&nbsp;Any target that utilises if_changed must be listed in $(targets),<BR>&nbsp;otherwise the command line check will fail, and the target will<BR>&nbsp;always be built.<BR>&nbsp;Assignments to $(targets) are without $(obj)/ prefix.<BR>&nbsp;if_changed may be used in conjunction with custom commands as<BR>&nbsp;defined in 6.8 "Custom kbuild commands".</P>
<P>&nbsp;Note: It is a typical mistake to forget the FORCE prerequisite.<BR>&nbsp;Another common pitfall is that whitespace is sometimes<BR>&nbsp;significant; for instance, the below will fail (note the extra space<BR>&nbsp;after the comma):<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;target: source(s) FORCE<BR>&nbsp;#WRONG!#&nbsp;$(call if_changed, ld/objcopy/gzip)
