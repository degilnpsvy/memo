Usually kbuild descends down in subdirectories due to "<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>",<BR>but in the architecture makefiles where the kbuild infrastructure<BR>is not sufficient this sometimes needs to be explicit. 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#arch/x86/boot/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;subdir- := compressed/</P>
<P>The above assignment instructs kbuild to descend down in the<BR>directory compressed/ when "make clean" is executed.
