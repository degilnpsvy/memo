SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Compiling and running the 3.x kernels requires up-to-date<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; versions of various software packages.&nbsp; Consult<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation/Changes for the minimum version numbers required<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; and how to get updates for these packages.&nbsp; Beware that using<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; excessively old versions of these packages can cause indirect<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; errors that are very difficult to track down, so don't assume that<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; you can just update packages when obvious problems arise during<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; build or operation.
