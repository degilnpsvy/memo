&nbsp; Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures<BR>&nbsp; as long as they have <FONT class=clozed>a paged memory management unit (PMMU)</FONT> and <FONT class=clozed>a port of the<BR>&nbsp; GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC)</FONT>. Linux has<BR>&nbsp; also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU, although<BR>&nbsp; functionality is then obviously somewhat limited.
