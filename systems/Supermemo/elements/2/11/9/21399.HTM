&nbsp;- You can also upgrade between 3.x releases by patching.&nbsp; Patches are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; distributed in the traditional gzip and the newer bzip2 format.&nbsp; To<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; install by patching, get all the newer patch files, enter the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; top level directory of the kernel source (linux-3.X) and execute:
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gzip -cd ../patch-3.x.gz | patch -p1</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; or</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bzip2 -dc ../patch-3.x.bz2 | patch -p1</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Replace "x" for all versions bigger than the version "X" of your current<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; source tree, _in_order_, and you should be ok.&nbsp; You may want to remove<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the backup files (some-file-name~ or some-file-name.orig), and make sure<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; that there are no failed patches (some-file-name# or some-file-name.rej).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; If there are, either you or I have made a mistake.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike patches for the 3.x kernels, patches for the 3.x.y kernels<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; (also known as the -stable kernels) are not incremental but instead apply<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; directly to the base 3.x kernel.&nbsp; For example, if your base kernel is 3.0<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; and you want to apply the 3.0.3 patch, you must not first apply the 3.0.1<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; and 3.0.2 patches. Similarly, if you are running kernel version 3.0.2 and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; want to jump to 3.0.3, you must first reverse the 3.0.2 patch (that is,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; patch -R) _before_ applying the 3.0.3 patch. You can read more on this in<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation/applying-patches.txt</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, the script patch-kernel can be used to automate this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; process.&nbsp; It determines the current kernel version and applies any<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; patches found.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The first argument in the command above is the location of the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel source.&nbsp; Patches are applied from the current directory, but<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; an alternative directory can be specified as the second argument.
