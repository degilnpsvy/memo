The <CODE>shell</CODE> function performs the same function that <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. This means that it takes as an argument a shell command and evaluates to the output of the command. The only processing <CODE>make</CODE> does on the result is <FONT class=clozed>to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a single space. If there is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it will simply be removed</FONT>.
