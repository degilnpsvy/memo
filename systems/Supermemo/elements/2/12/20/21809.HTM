device_register<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>When a new device is added, the bus's list of drivers is iterated over<BR>to find one that supports it. In order to determine that, the device<BR>ID of the device must match one of the device IDs that the driver<BR>supports. The format and semantics for comparing IDs is bus-specific. <BR>Instead of trying to derive a complex state machine and matching<BR>algorithm, <FONT class=extract>it is up to the bus driver to provide a callback to compare<BR>a device against the IDs of a driver.</FONT> The bus returns 1 if a match was<BR>found; 0 otherwise.</P>
<P>int match(struct device * dev, struct device_driver * drv);</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If a match is found, the device's driver field is set to the driver<BR>and the driver's probe callback is called. This gives the driver a<BR>chance to verify that it really does support the hardware, and that<BR>it's in a working state.</FONT>
