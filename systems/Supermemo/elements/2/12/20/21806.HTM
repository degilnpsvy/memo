User Interface<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<P></P>
<P>By virtue of having a complete hierarchical view of all the devices in the<BR>system, exporting a complete hierarchical view to userspace becomes relatively<BR>easy. This has been accomplished by implementing a special purpose virtual<BR>file system named sysfs.</P>
<P>Almost all mainstream Linux distros mount this filesystem automatically; you<BR>can see some variation of the following in the output of the "mount" command:</P>
<P>$ mount<BR>...<BR>none on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)<BR>...<BR>$</P>
<P>The auto-mounting of sysfs is typically accomplished by an entry similar to<BR>the following in the /etc/fstab file:</P>
<P>none&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;/sys&nbsp;sysfs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defaults&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0 0</P>
<P>or something similar in the /lib/init/fstab file on Debian-based systems:</P>
<P>none&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sysfs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nodev,noexec,nosuid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0</P>
<P>If sysfs is not automatically mounted, you can always do it manually with:</P>
<P># mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys</P>
<P>Whenever a device is inserted into the tree, a directory is created for it.<BR>This directory may be populated at each layer of discovery - the global layer,<BR>the bus layer, or the device layer.</P>
<P>The global layer currently creates two files - 'name' and 'power'. The<BR>former only reports the name of the device. The latter reports the<BR>current power state of the device. It will also be used to set the current<BR>power state. </P>
<P>The bus layer may also create files for the devices it finds while probing the<BR>bus. For example, the PCI layer currently creates 'irq' and 'resource' files<BR>for each PCI device.</P>
<P>A device-specific driver may also export files in its directory to expose<BR>device-specific data or tunable interfaces.</P>
<P>More information about the sysfs directory layout can be found in<BR>the other documents in this directory and in the file <BR>Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt.
