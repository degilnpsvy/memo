driver_register<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>The process is almost identical for when a new driver is added. <BR>The bus's list of devices is iterated over to find a match. Devices<BR>that <FONT class=clozed>already have a driver </FONT>are skipped. All the devices are iterated<BR>over, to <FONT class=clozed>bind as many devices as possible to the driver</FONT>.
