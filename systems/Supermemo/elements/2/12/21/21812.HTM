sysfs<BR>~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>A symlink is created in the bus's 'devices' directory that points to<BR>the device's directory in the physical hierarchy.</P>
<P>A symlink is created in the driver's 'devices' directory that points<BR>to the device's directory in the physical hierarchy.</P>
<P>A directory for the device is created in the class's directory. A<BR>symlink is created in that directory that points to the device's<BR>physical location in the sysfs tree. </P>
<P>A symlink can be created (though this isn't done yet) in the device's<BR>physical directory to either its class directory, or the class's<BR>top-level directory. One can also be created to point to its driver's<BR>directory also.
