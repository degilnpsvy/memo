Removal<BR>~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>When a device is removed, the reference count for it will eventually<BR>go to 0. When it does, the remove callback of the driver is called. It<BR>is removed from the driver's list of devices and the reference count<BR>of the driver is decremented. All symlinks between the two are removed.</P>
<P>When a driver is removed, the list of devices that it supports is<BR>iterated over, and the driver's remove callback is called for each<BR>one. The device is removed from that list and the symlinks removed.
