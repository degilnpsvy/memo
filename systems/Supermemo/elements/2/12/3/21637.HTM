The <A href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/" target=_top>Cygwin</A> package from Cygnus and the <A href="http://www.mkssoftware.com/" target=_top>MKS utilities</A> from Mortice Kern Associates add shell scripting capabilities to Windows.</P>
<P>Another alternative is <A href="http://www2.research.att.com/~gsf/download/uwin/uwin.html" target=_top>UWIN</A>, written by David Korn of AT&amp;T, of <A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#KORNSHELLREF">Korn Shell</A> fame.</P>
