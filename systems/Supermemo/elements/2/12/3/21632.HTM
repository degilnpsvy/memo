<P>A brief warning about script security is indicated. A shell script may contain a <I class=FIRSTTERM>worm</I>, <I class=FIRSTTERM>trojan</I>, or even a <I class=FIRSTTERM>virus</I>. For that reason, never run as <I class=FIRSTTERM>root</I> a script (or permit it to be inserted into the system startup scripts in <TT class=FILENAME>/etc/rc.d</TT>) unless you have obtained said script from a trusted source or you have carefully analyzed it to make certain it does nothing harmful.</P>
<P>Various researchers at Bell Labs and other sites, including M. Douglas McIlroy, Tom Duff, and Fred Cohen have investigated the implications of shell script viruses. They conclude that it is all too easy for even a novice, a <SPAN class=QUOTE>"script kiddie,"</SPAN> to write one. <A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#FTN.AEN20748" name=AEN20748><SPAN class=footnote>[128]</SPAN></A> </P>
<P>Here is yet another reason to learn scripting. Being able to look at and understand scripts may protect your system from being compromised by a rogue script.</P></DIV>
