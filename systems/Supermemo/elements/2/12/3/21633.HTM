<H2 class=SECT2><A name=HIDINGSOURCE></A>36.8.2. Hiding Shell Script Source</H2>
<P>For security purposes, it may be necessary to render a script unreadable. If only there were a utility to create a stripped binary executable from a script. Francisco Rosales' <A href="http://www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~frosal/sources/" target=_top>shc -- generic shell script compiler</A> does exactly that.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, according to <A href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8256" target=_top>an article</A> in the October, 2005 <EM>Linux Journal</EM>, the binary can, in at least some cases, be decrypted to recover the original script source. Still, this could be a useful method of keeping scripts secure from all but the most skilled hackers.
