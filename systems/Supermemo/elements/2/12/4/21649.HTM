<P>If you need assistance with a schoolwork assignment, read the pertinent sections of this and other reference works. Do your best to solve the problem using your own wits and resources. <EM>Please do not waste the author's time.</EM> You will get neither help nor sympathy. <A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#FTN.AEN21329" name=AEN21329><SPAN class=footnote>[139]</SPAN></A> </P>
<P>Likewise, kindly refrain from annoying the author with solicitations, offers of employment, or <SPAN class=QUOTE>"business opportunities."</SPAN> He is doing just fine, and requires neither help nor sympathy, thank you.</P>
<P>Please note that the author will <EM>not</EM> answer scripting questions for Sun/Solaris/Oracle or Apple systems. The endarkened execs and the arachnoid corporate attorneys of those particular outfits have been using litigation in a predatory manner and/or as a weapon against the Open Source Community. Any Solaris or Apple users needing scripting help will therefore kindly direct their concerns to corporate customer service.</P>
