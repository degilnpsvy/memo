<P><EM>Community participation made this project possible.</EM> The author gratefully acknowledges that writing this book would have been unthinkable without help and feedback from all you people out there.</P>
<P><A href="mailto:feloy@free.fr" target=_top>Philippe Martin</A> translated the first version (0.1) of this document into DocBook/SGML. While not on the job at a small French company as a software developer, he enjoys working on GNU/Linux documentation and software, reading literature, playing music, and, for his peace of mind, making merry with friends. You may run across him somewhere in France or in the Basque Country, or you can email him at <A href="mailto:feloy@free.fr" target=_top>feloy@free.fr</A>.</P>
<P>Philippe Martin also pointed out that positional parameters past $9 are possible using {bracket} notation. (See <A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#EX17">Example 4-5</A>).</P>
<P><A href="mailto:stephane_chazelas@yahoo.fr" target=_top>St&#233;phane Chazelas</A> sent a long list of corrections, additions, and example scripts. More than a contributor, he had, in effect, for a while taken on the role of <EM>co-editor</EM> for this document. <I class=FOREIGNPHRASE>Merci beaucoup!</I></P>
<P>Paulo Marcel Coelho Aragao offered many corrections, both major and minor, and contributed quite a number of helpful suggestions.</P>
<P>I would like to especially thank <EM>Patrick Callahan</EM>, <EM>Mike Novak</EM>, and <EM>Pal Domokos</EM> for catching bugs, pointing out ambiguities, and for suggesting clarifications and changes in the preliminary version (0.1) of this document. Their lively discussion of shell scripting and general documentation issues inspired me to try to make this document more readable.</P>
<P>I'm grateful to Jim Van Zandt for pointing out errors and omissions in version 0.2 of this document. He also contributed an instructive <A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#ZFIFO">example script</A>.</P>
<P>Many thanks to <A href="mailto:mikaku@fiwix.org" target=_top>Jordi Sanfeliu</A> for giving permission to use his fine tree script (<A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#TREE">Example A-16</A>), and to Rick Boivie for revising it.</P>

<P><A href="mailto:heiner.steven@odn.de" target=_top>Heiner Steven</A> kindly gave permission to use his base conversion script, <A href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/abs-guide.html#BASE">Example 16-48</A>. He also made a number of corrections and many helpful suggestions. Special thanks.</P>

<P>My gratitude to <A href="mailto:chet@po.cwru.edu" target=_top>Chet Ramey</A> and Brian Fox for writing <I class=FIRSTTERM>Bash</I>, and building into it elegant and powerful scripting capabilities rivaling those of <I class=FIRSTTERM>ksh</I>.</P>
<P>Very special thanks to the hard-working volunteers at the <A href="http://www.tldp.org/" target=_top>Linux Documentation Project</A>. The LDP hosts a repository of Linux knowledge and lore, and has, to a great extent, enabled the publication of this book.</P>
<P>Thanks and appreciation to IBM, Red Hat, Google, the <A href="http://www.fsf.org/" target=_top>Free Software Foundation</A>, and all the good people fighting the good fight to keep Open Source software free and open.</P>
<P>Belated thanks to my fourth grade teacher, Miss Spencer, for emotional support and for convincing me that maybe, just maybe I wasn't a total loss.</P>
<P>Thanks most of all to my wife, Anita, for her encouragement, inspiration, and emotional support.
