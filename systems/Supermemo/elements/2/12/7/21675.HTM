  # ==&gt; Uses named pipe, /pipe, to communicate between processes:
  # ==&gt; 'tar/gzip' writes to /pipe and 'ssh' reads from /pipe.

  # ==&gt; The end result is this backs up the main directories, from / on down.

  # ==&gt;  What are the advantages of a "named pipe" in this situation,
  # ==&gt;+ as opposed to an "anonymous pipe", with |?
  # ==&gt;  Will an anonymous pipe even work here?

  # ==&gt;  Is it necessary to delete the pipe before exiting the script?
  # ==&gt;  How could that be done?
