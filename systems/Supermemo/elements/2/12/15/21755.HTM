&nbsp;- Verbose kernel compile/build output: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Normally, the kernel build system runs in a fairly quiet mode (but not<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; totally silent).&nbsp; However, sometimes you or other kernel developers need<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; to see compile, link, or other commands exactly as they are executed.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this, use "verbose" build mode.&nbsp; This is done by inserting<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "V=1" in the "make" command.&nbsp; E.g.:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make V=1 all</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To have the build system also tell <FONT class=clozed>the reason for the rebuild of each<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; target</FONT>, use "V=2".&nbsp; The default is "V=0".
