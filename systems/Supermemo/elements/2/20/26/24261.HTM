On 32-bit x86 systems, the default kernel configuration splits the available 4GB address space into a 3GB virtual memory space for user processes and a 1GB space for the kernel, as shown in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch02lev1sec7.html#ch02fig03">Figure 2.5</A><A name="memory that"></A>. This imposes a 1GB limit on the amount of physical memory that the kernel can handle. In reality, the limit is 896MB because 128MB of the address space is occupied by kernel data structures. You may increase this limit by changing the 3GB/1GB split during kernel configuration, but you will incur the displeasure of memory-intensive applications if you reduce the virtual address space of user processes.
