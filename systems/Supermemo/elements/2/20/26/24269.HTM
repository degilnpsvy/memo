<P class=docText>The basic usage of spinlocks is as follows:</P>
<DIV class=docText><PRE>#include <LINUX spinlock.h="">
<FONT class=clozed>spinlock_t mylock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED; /* Initialize */

/* Acquire the spinlock. This is inexpensive if there
 * is no one inside the critical section. In the face of
 * contention, spinlock() has to busy-wait.
 */
spin_lock(&amp;mylock);

/* ... Critical Section code ... */

spin_unlock(&amp;mylock); /* Release the lock */</FONT></PRE></DIV>
