button_interrupt()
<P></P>
<P>which upon every interrupt from the button checks its state and reports it<BR>via the</P>
<P>&nbsp;input_report_key()</P>
<P>call to the input system. There is no need to check whether the interrupt<BR>routine isn't reporting two same value events (press, press for example) to<BR>the input system, because the input_report_* functions check that<BR>themselves.</P>
<P>Then there is the</P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT class=clozed>input_sync()</FONT></P>
<P>call to tell those who receive the events that we've sent a complete report.<BR>This doesn't seem important in the one button case, but is quite important<BR>for for example mouse movement, where you don't want the X and Y values<BR>to be interpreted separately, because that'd result in a different movement.
