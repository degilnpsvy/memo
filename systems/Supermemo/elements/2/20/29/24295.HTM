<P class=docText>If you need to allocate large memory buffers, and you don't require the memory to be physically contiguous, use <TT>vmalloc()</TT> rather than <TT>kmalloc()</TT>:</P>
<DIV class=docText><PRE>void *vmalloc(unsigned long count);</PRE></DIV><BR>
<P class=docText>Here <TT>count</TT> is the requested allocation size. The function returns kernel virtual addresses.</P>
<P class=docText><TT>vmalloc()</TT> enjoys bigger allocation size limits than <TT>kmalloc()</TT><A name="cannot use"></A> but is slower and can't be called from interrupt context. Moreover, you cannot use the physically discontiguous memory returned by <TT>vmalloc()</TT> to perform <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Direct Memory Access</SPAN> (DMA). High-performance network drivers commonly use <TT>vmalloc()</TT><A name="the device"></A> to allocate large descriptor rings when the device is opened.
