<P class=docText><A name="a closer"></A>Let's take a closer look at what this means. Linux user processes own a virtual address space of 3GB (see the section "<A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch02lev1sec7.html#ch02lev1sec7">Allocating Memory</A><A name="there are"></A>"). Out of this, the pages constituting the "working set" are kept in RAM. However, when there are too many programs demanding memory resources, the kernel frees up some used RAM pages by storing them in a disk partition called <SPAN class=docEmphasis><A name="swap space"></A>swap space.</SPAN><A name="a rule"></A> According to a rule of thumb, the size of the swap partition should be twice the amount of RAM. In this case, the swap space lives in the disk partition <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/dev/hda6</SPAN><A name="has a"></A> and has a size of 1552384K bytes.
