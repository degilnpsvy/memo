<P class=docText>In this case, you need to disable only interrupts to protect the critical region. To see why, assume that A and B are process context threads, and C is an interrupt context thread, all vying to enter the same critical section, as shown in <A class=docLink href="http://www.embeddedlinux.org.cn/EssentialLinuxDeviceDrivers/final/ch02lev1sec5.html#ch02fig02">Figure 2.4</A>.</P>

<P class=docText><A name=iddle2837></A><A name="always runs"></A>Because Thread C is executing in interrupt context and always runs to completion before yielding to Thread A or Thread B, it need not worry about protection. Thread A, for its part, need not be concerned about Thread B (and vice versa) because the kernel is not preemptible. Thus, Thread A and Thread B need to guard against only the possibility of Thread C stomping through the critical section while they are inside the same section. They achieve this by disabling interrupts prior to entering the critical section:</P>
<DIV class=docText><PRE>Point A:
  local_irq_disable();  /* Disable Interrupts in local CPU */
  /* ... Critical Section ...  */
  local_irq_enable();   /* Enable Interrupts in local CPU */</PRE></DIV><BR>
<P class=docText><A name="when execution"></A>However, if interrupts were already disabled when execution reached Point A, <TT>local_irq_enable()</TT><A name="restoring interrupt"></A> creates the unpleasant side effect of reenabling interrupts, rather than restoring interrupt state. This can be fixed as follows:</P>
<DIV class=docText><PRE>unsigned long flags;

Point A:
  local_irq_save(flags);     /* Disable Interrupts */
  /* ... Critical Section ... */
  local_irq_restore(flags);  /* Restore state to what
                                it was at Point A */</PRE></DIV><BR>
<P class=docText><A name=iddle1620></A><A name=iddle3632></A><A name=iddle3633></A><A name=iddle3634></A><A name="interrupt state"></A>This works correctly irrespective of the interrupt state at Point A.
