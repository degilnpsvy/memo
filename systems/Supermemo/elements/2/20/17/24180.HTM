<P class=docText>However, if a writer thread enters a critical section, other reader or writer threads are not allowed inside. To use writer spinlocks, you would write this:</P>
<DIV class=docText><PRE><FONT class=clozed>rwlock_t myrwlock = RW_LOCK_UNLOCKED;

write_lock(&amp;myrwlock);    /* Acquire writer lock */
/* ... Critical Region ... */
write_unlock(&amp;myrwlock);  /* Release lock */</FONT></PRE></DIV>
