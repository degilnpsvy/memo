In kernel terms, sub-jiffy delays qualify as short durations. Such delays are commonly requested from both process and interrupt contexts. Because it is not possible to use jiffy-based methods to implement sub-jiffy delays, the methods discussed in the previous section to sleep-wait cannot be used for small timeouts. The only solution is to <FONT class=clozed>busy-wait</FONT>.
