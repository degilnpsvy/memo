Look at the IPX routing code present in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>net/ipx/ipx_route.c</SPAN> for a real-life example of a reader-writer spinlock. A reader-writer lock called <TT>ipx_routes_lock</TT><A name="need to"></A> protects the IPX routing table from simultaneous access. Threads that need to look up the routing table to forward packets request reader locks. Threads that need to add or delete entries from the routing table acquire writer locks. This improves performance because there are usually far more instances of routing table lookups than routing table updates.
