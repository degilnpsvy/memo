The two flags listed above are similar to ccflags-y and asflags-y.<BR>&nbsp;The difference is that the subdir- variants have effect for the kbuild<BR>&nbsp;file where they are present and all subdirectories.<BR>&nbsp;Options specified using subdir-* are added to the commandline before<BR>&nbsp;the options specified using the non-subdir variants.
