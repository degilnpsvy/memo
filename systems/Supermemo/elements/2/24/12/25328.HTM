<P><FONT class=extract>There are many cases where an asynchronous process execution context<BR>is needed and the workqueue (wq) API is the most commonly used<BR>mechanism for such cases.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>When such an asynchronous execution context is needed, a work item<BR>describing which function to execute is put on a queue.&nbsp; An<BR>independent thread serves as the asynchronous execution context.&nbsp; The<BR>queue is called workqueue and the thread is called worker.</FONT></P>
<P>While there are work items on the workqueue the worker executes the<BR>functions associated with the work items one after the other.&nbsp; When<BR>there is no work item left on the workqueue the worker becomes idle.<BR>When a new work item gets queued, the worker begins executing again.
