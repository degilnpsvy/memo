Directory Creation<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>For every kobject that is registered with the system, a directory is<BR>created for it in sysfs. That directory is created as a subdirectory<BR>of the kobject's parent, expressing internal object hierarchies to<BR>userspace. Top-level directories in sysfs represent the common<BR>ancestors of object hierarchies; i.e. the subsystems the objects<BR>belong to. </P>
<P>Sysfs internally stores a pointer to the kobject that implements a<BR>directory in the sysfs_dirent object associated with the directory. In<BR>the past this kobject pointer has been used by sysfs to do reference<BR>counting directly on the kobject whenever the file is opened or closed.<BR>With the current sysfs implementation the kobject reference count is<BR>only modified directly by the function (changed after 3.10)sysfs_schedule_callback().
