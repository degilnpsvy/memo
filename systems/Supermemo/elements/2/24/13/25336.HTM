Forward progress guarantee relies on that workers can be created when<BR>more execution contexts are necessary, which in turn is guaranteed<BR>through the use of <FONT class=clozed>rescue workers.&nbsp; All work items which might be used<BR>on code paths that handle memory reclaim are required to be queued on<BR>wq's that have a rescue-worker reserved for execution under memory<BR>pressure.&nbsp; Else it is possible that the worker-pool deadlocks waiting<BR>for execution contexts to free up.</FONT>
