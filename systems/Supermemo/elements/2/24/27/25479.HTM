use the open and close callback to know when it can stop polling or release the interrupt and when it must resume polling or grab the interrupt again. </P>
<P>Note that input core keeps track of number of users for the device and makes sure that dev-&gt;open() is called only when the first user connects to the device and that dev-&gt;close() is called when the very last user disconnects. Calls to both callbacks are serialized. </P>
<P>The open() callback should return a 0 in case of success or any nonzero value in case of failure. The close() callback (which is void) must always succeed.
