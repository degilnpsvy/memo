There are some situations where you can optimize the gets and puts.<BR>For instance, if you are done with an object and enqueuing it for<BR>something else or passing it off to something else, there is no reason<BR>to do a get then a put: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;/* Silly extra get and put */<BR>&nbsp;kref_get(&amp;obj-&gt;ref);<BR>&nbsp;enqueue(obj);<BR>&nbsp;kref_put(&amp;obj-&gt;ref, obj_cleanup);</P>
<P>Just do the enqueue.&nbsp; A comment about this is always welcome:<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>/
