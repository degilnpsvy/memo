Top Level Directory Layout<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>The sysfs directory arrangement exposes the relationship of kernel<BR>data structures. </P>
<P>The top level sysfs directory looks like:</P>
<P>block/<BR>bus/<BR>class/<BR>dev/<BR>devices/<BR>firmware/<BR>net/<BR>fs/</P>
<P>devices/ contains a filesystem representation of the device tree. It maps<BR>directly to the internal kernel device tree, which is a hierarchy of<BR>struct device. </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>bus/ contains flat directory layout of the various bus types in the<BR>kernel. Each bus's directory contains two subdirectories:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;devices/<BR>&nbsp;drivers/</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>devices/ contains symlinks for each device discovered in the system<BR>that point to the device's directory under root/.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>drivers/ contains a directory for each device driver that is loaded<BR>for devices on that particular bus (this assumes that drivers do not<BR>span multiple bus types).</FONT></P>
<P>fs/ contains a directory for some filesystems.&nbsp; Currently each<BR>filesystem wanting to export attributes must create its own hierarchy<BR>below fs/ (see ./fuse.txt for an example).</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>dev/ contains two directories char/ and block/. Inside these two<BR>directories there are symlinks named &lt;major&gt;:&lt;minor&gt;.&nbsp; These symlinks<BR>point to the sysfs directory for the given device.&nbsp; /sys/dev provides a<BR>quick way to lookup the sysfs interface for a device from the result of<BR>a stat(2) operation.</FONT></P>
<P>More information can driver-model specific features can be found in<BR>Documentation/driver-model/. </P>
<P><BR>TODO: Finish this section.
