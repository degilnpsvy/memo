<P>--- 7.1 Testing for CONFIG_FOO_BAR</P>
<P>&nbsp;Modules often need to check for certain CONFIG_ options to<BR>&nbsp;decide if a specific feature is included in the module. In<BR>&nbsp;kbuild this is done by referencing the CONFIG_ variable<BR>&nbsp;directly.<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;External modules have traditionally used "grep" to check for<BR>&nbsp;specific CONFIG_ settings directly in .config. This usage is<BR>&nbsp;broken. As introduced before, external modules should use<BR>&nbsp;kbuild for building and can therefore use the same methods as<BR>&nbsp;in-tree modules when testing for CONFIG_ definitions.
