Within the kernel, header files are kept in standard locations<BR>according to the following rule: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;* If the header file only describes the internal interface of a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; module, then the file is placed<FONT class=clozed> in the same directory as the<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; source file</FONT>s.<BR>&nbsp;* If the header file describes an interface used by other parts<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; of the kernel that are located in different directories, then<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the file is placed <FONT class=clozed>in include/linux/</FONT>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: There are two notable exceptions to this rule: <FONT class=clozed>larger<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; subsystems have their own directory under include/, such as<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; include/scsi</FONT>; and <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
