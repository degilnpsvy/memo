Module versioning is enabled by the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> tag, and is used<BR>as a simple ABI consistency check. A CRC value of the full prototype<BR>for an exported symbol is created. When a module is loaded/used, the<BR>CRC values contained in the kernel are compared with similar values in<BR>the module; if they are not equal, the kernel refuses to load the<BR>module. 
<P></P>
<P>Module.symvers contains a list of all exported symbols from a kernel<BR>build.
