&nbsp; This attribute is only applicable to menu blocks, if the condition is<BR>&nbsp; false, the menu block is not displayed to the user (the symbols<BR>&nbsp; contained there can still be selected by other symbols, though). It is<BR>&nbsp; similar to a conditional "prompt" attribute for individual menu<BR>&nbsp; entries. Default value of "visible" is true.
