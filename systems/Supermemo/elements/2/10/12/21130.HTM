to use the "make" target "modules_prepare." This will<BR>make sure the kernel contains the information required. The target<BR>exists solely as a simple way to prepare a kernel source tree for<BR>building external modules.

<P>NOTE: "modules_prepare" will not build Module.symvers even if<BR>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set; therefore, a full kernel build needs to be<BR>executed to make module versioning work.
