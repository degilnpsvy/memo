Usually kbuild descends down in subdirectories due to "<FONT class=clozed>obj-* := dir/</FONT>",<BR>but in the architecture makefiles where the kbuild infrastructure<BR>is not sufficient this sometimes needs to be explicit.

<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;&nbsp;#arch/x86/boot/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;subdir- := compressed/</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The above assignment instructs kbuild to descend down in the<BR>directory compressed/ when "make clean" is executed.</FONT>
