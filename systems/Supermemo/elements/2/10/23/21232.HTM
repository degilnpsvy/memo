To delete a directory hierarchy use: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#scripts/package/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;<FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;clean-dir</FONT>s := $(objtree)/debian/</P>
<P>This will delete the directory debian, including all subdirectories.<BR>Kbuild will assume the directories to be in the same relative path as the<BR>Makefile if no absolute path is specified (path does not start with '/').
