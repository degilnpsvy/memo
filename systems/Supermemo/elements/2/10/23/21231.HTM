Additional files can be specified in kbuild makefiles by use of $(clean-files). 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#drivers/pci/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;clean-files := devlist.h classlist.h</P>
<P>When executing "make clean", the two files "devlist.h classlist.h" will<BR>be deleted. Kbuild will assume files to be in same relative directory as the<BR>Makefile except if an absolute path is specified (path starting with '/').
