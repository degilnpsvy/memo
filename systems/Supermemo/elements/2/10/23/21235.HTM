To support the clean infrastructure in the Makefiles that builds the<BR>final bootimage there is an optional target named <FONT class=clozed>archclean: </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#arch/x86/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;archclean:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$(Q)$(MAKE) $(clean)=arch/x86/boot</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>When "make clean" is executed, make will descend down in arch/x86/boot,<BR>and clean as usual. The Makefile located in arch/x86/boot/ may use<BR>the subdir- trick to descend further down</FONT>.
