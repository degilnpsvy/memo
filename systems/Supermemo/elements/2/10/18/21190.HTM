--- 6.2 Add prerequisites to archheaders:</P>
<P>&nbsp;The archheaders: rule is used to generate header files that<BR>&nbsp;may be installed into user space by "make header_install" or<BR>&nbsp;"make headers_install_all".&nbsp; In order to support<BR>&nbsp;"make headers_install_all", this target has to be able to run<BR>&nbsp;on an unconfigured tree, or a tree configured for another<BR>&nbsp;architecture.</P>
<P>&nbsp;It is run before "make archprepare" when run on the<BR>&nbsp;architecture itself.
