select will force<BR>&nbsp;a symbol to a value without visiting the dependencies.<BR>&nbsp;By abusing select you are able to select a symbol FOO even<BR>&nbsp;if FOO depends on BAR that is not set.<BR>&nbsp;In general use select only for non-visible symbols<BR>&nbsp;(no prompts anywhere) and for symbols with no dependencies.<BR>&nbsp;That will limit the usefulness but on the other hand avoid<BR>&nbsp;the illegal configurations all over.
