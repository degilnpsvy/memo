--- 6.3 Add prerequisites to archprepare:
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;The archprepare: rule is used to list prerequisites that need to be<BR>&nbsp;built before starting to descend down in the subdirectories.<BR>&nbsp;This is usually used for header files containing assembler constants.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#arch/arm/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;archprepare: maketools</P>
<P>&nbsp;In this example, the file target maketools will be processed<BR>&nbsp;before descending down in the subdirectories.<BR>&nbsp;See also chapter XXX-TODO that describe how kbuild supports<BR>&nbsp;generating offset header files.
