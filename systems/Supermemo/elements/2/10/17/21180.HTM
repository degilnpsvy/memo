While normal dependencies reduce the upper limit of a symbol (see<BR>&nbsp; below), reverse dependencies can be used to force a lower limit of<BR>&nbsp; another symbol. The value of the current menu symbol is used as the<BR>&nbsp; minimal value &lt;symbol&gt; can be set to. If &lt;symbol&gt; is selected multiple<BR>&nbsp; times, the limit is set to the largest selection.<BR>&nbsp; Reverse dependencies can only be used with boolean or tristate<BR>&nbsp; symbols.<BR>&nbsp; Note:<BR>&nbsp;select should be used with care. <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>
