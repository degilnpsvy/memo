--- 4.1 Simple Host Program 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;In some cases there is a need to compile and run a program on the<BR>&nbsp;computer where the build is running.<BR>&nbsp;The following line tells kbuild that the program bin2hex shall be<BR>&nbsp;built on the build host.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>&nbsp;Kbuild assumes in the above example that bin2hex is made from a single<BR>&nbsp;c-source file named bin2hex.c located in the same directory as<BR>&nbsp;the Makefile.
