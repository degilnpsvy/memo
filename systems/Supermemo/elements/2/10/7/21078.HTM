in the MODPOST step. modpost obtains<BR>&nbsp;the symbols by reading Module.symvers from the kernel source<BR>&nbsp;tree. If a Module.symvers file is present in the directory<BR>&nbsp;where the external module is being built, this file will be<BR>&nbsp;read too. During the MODPOST step, a new Module.symvers file<BR>&nbsp;will be written containing all exported symbols that were not<BR>&nbsp;defined in the kernel.
