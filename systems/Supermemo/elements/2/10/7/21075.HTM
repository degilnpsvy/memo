--- 4.2 Single Subdirectory 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;External modules tend to place header files in a separate<BR>&nbsp;include/ directory where their source is located, although this<BR>&nbsp;is not the usual kernel style. To inform kbuild of the<BR>&nbsp;directory, use either <SPAN class=cloze>[...] </SPAN>or CFLAGS_&lt;filename&gt;.o.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Using the example from section 3, if we moved 8123_if.h to a<BR>&nbsp;subdirectory named include, the resulting kbuild file would<BR>&nbsp;look like:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;--&gt; filename: Kbuild<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;obj-m := 8123.o</P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;8123-y := 8123_if.o 8123_pci.o 8123_bin.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;Note that in the assignment there is no space between -I and<BR>&nbsp;the path. This is a limitation of kbuild: there must be no<BR>&nbsp;space present.
