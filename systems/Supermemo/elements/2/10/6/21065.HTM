--- 4.3 Defining shared libraries</P>
<P>&nbsp;Objects with extension .so are considered shared libraries, and<BR>&nbsp;will be compiled as position independent objects.<BR>&nbsp;Kbuild provides support for shared libraries, but the usage<BR>&nbsp;shall be restricted.<BR>&nbsp;In the following example the libkconfig.so shared library is used<BR>&nbsp;to link the executable conf.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#scripts/kconfig/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;hostprogs-y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; := conf<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;conf-objs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; := conf.o libkconfig.so<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;libkconfig-objs := expr.o type.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;Shared libraries always require a corresponding -objs line, and<BR>&nbsp;in the example above the shared library libkconfig is composed by<BR>&nbsp;the two objects expr.o and type.o.<BR>&nbsp;expr.o and type.o will be built as position independent code and<BR>&nbsp;linked as a shared library libkconfig.so. C++ is not supported for<BR>&nbsp;shared libraries.
