=== 4 Host Program support 
<P>Kbuild supports building executables on the host for use during the<BR>compilation stage.<BR>Two steps are required in order to use a host executable.</P>
<P>The first step is to tell kbuild that a host program exists. This is<BR>done utilising the variable hostprogs-y.</P>
<P>The second step is to add an explicit dependency to the executable.<BR>This can be done in two ways. Either add the dependency in a rule,<BR>or utilise the variable $(always).<BR>Both possibilities are described in the following.
