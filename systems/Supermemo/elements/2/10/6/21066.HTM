--- 4.4 Using C++ for host programs</P>
<P>&nbsp;kbuild offers support for host programs written in C++. This was<BR>&nbsp;introduced solely to support kconfig, and is not recommended<BR>&nbsp;for general use.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#scripts/kconfig/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;hostprogs-y&nbsp;&nbsp; := qconf<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;qconf-cxxobjs := qconf.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;In the example above the executable is composed of the C++ file<BR>&nbsp;qconf.cc - identified by $(qconf-cxxobjs).</P>
<P>&nbsp;If qconf is composed by a mixture of .c and .cc files, then an<BR>&nbsp;additional line can be used to identify this.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#scripts/kconfig/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;hostprogs-y&nbsp;&nbsp; := qconf<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;qconf-cxxobjs := qconf.o<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;qconf-objs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; := check.o
