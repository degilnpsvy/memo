The kernel include a set of headers that is exported to userspace.<BR>Many headers can be exported as-is but other headers require a<BR>minimal pre-processing before they are ready for user-space.<BR>The pre-processing does:<BR>- drop kernel specific annotations<BR>- drop include of compiler.h<BR>- drop all sections that are kernel internal (guarded by ifdef __KERNEL__)

<P>Each relevant directory contains a file name "Kbuild" which specifies the<BR>headers to be exported.<BR>See subsequent chapter for the syntax of the Kbuild file.
