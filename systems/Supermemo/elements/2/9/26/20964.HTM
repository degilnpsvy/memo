done by analyzing the dependencies. If a menu entry somehow depends on the previous entry, it can be made a submenu of it. First, the previous (parent) symbol must be part of the dependency list and then one of these two conditions<BR>must be true:<BR>- the child entry must become invisible, if the parent is set to 'n'<BR>- the child entry must only be visible, if the parent is visible

<P>config MODULES<BR>&nbsp;bool "Enable loadable module support" </P>
<P></P>
<P>config MODVERSIONS<BR>&nbsp;bool "Set version information on all module symbols"<BR>&nbsp;depends on MODULES</P>
<P>comment "module support disabled"<BR>&nbsp;depends on !MODULES</P>
<P>MODVERSIONS directly depends on MODULES, this means it's only visible if<BR>MODULES is different from 'n'. The comment on the other hand is always<BR>visible when MODULES is visible (the (empty) dependency of MODULES is<BR>also part of the comment dependencies).
