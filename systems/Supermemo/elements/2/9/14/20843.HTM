=== 9 Makefile language 
<P>The kernel Makefiles are designed to be run with GNU Make.&nbsp; The Makefiles<BR>use only the documented features of GNU Make, but they do use many<BR>GNU extensions.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>GNU Make supports elementary list-processing functions.&nbsp; The kernel<BR>Makefiles use a novel style of list building and manipulation with few<BR>"if" statements.</FONT></P>
<P>GNU Make has two assignment operators, ":=" and "=".&nbsp; ":=" performs<BR>immediate evaluation of the right-hand side and stores an actual string<BR>into the left-hand side.&nbsp; "=" is like a formula definition; it stores the<BR>right-hand side in an unevaluated form and then evaluates this form each<BR>time the left-hand side is used.</P>
<P>There are some cases where "=" is appropriate.&nbsp; Usually, though, ":="<BR>is the right choice.
