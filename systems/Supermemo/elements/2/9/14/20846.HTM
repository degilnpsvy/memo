<FONT class=extract>The top Makefile is responsible for building two major products: vmlinux<BR>(the resident kernel image) and modules (any module files).<BR></FONT>It builds these goals by recursively descending into the subdirectories of<BR>the kernel source tree.<BR><FONT class=extract>The list of subdirectories which are visited depends upon the kernel<BR>configuration. The top Makefile textually includes an arch Makefile<BR>with the name arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile. The arch Makefile supplies<BR>architecture-specific information to the top Makefile.</FONT>
