The top Makefile exports the following variables: 
<P></P>
<P>VERSION, PATCHLEVEL, SUBLEVEL, EXTRAVERSION</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;These variables define the current kernel version.&nbsp; A few arch<BR>&nbsp;Makefiles actually use these values directly; they should use<BR>&nbsp;$(KERNELRELEASE) instead.</P>
<P>&nbsp;$(VERSION), $(PATCHLEVEL), and $(SUBLEVEL) define the basic<BR>&nbsp;three-part version number, such as "2", "4", and "0".&nbsp; These three<BR>&nbsp;values are always numeric.</P>
<P>&nbsp;$(EXTRAVERSION) defines an even tinier sublevel for pre-patches<BR>&nbsp;or additional patches.&nbsp;It is usually some non-numeric string<BR>&nbsp;such as "-pre4", and is often blank.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KERNELRELEASE</P>
<P>&nbsp;$(KERNELRELEASE) is a single string such as "2.4.0-pre4", suitable<BR>&nbsp;for constructing installation directory names or showing in<BR>&nbsp;version strings.&nbsp; Some arch Makefiles use it for this purpose.
