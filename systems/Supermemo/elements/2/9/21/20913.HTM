<P>- help text: "help" or "---help---"<BR>&nbsp; This defines a help text. The end of the help text is determined <FONT class=clozed>by<BR>&nbsp; the indentation level, this means it ends at the first line which has<BR>&nbsp; a smaller indentation than the first line of the help text</FONT>.<BR>&nbsp; "---help---" and "help" do not differ in behaviour, "---help---" is<BR>&nbsp; used to help visually separate configuration logic from help within<BR>&nbsp; the file as an aid to developers.
