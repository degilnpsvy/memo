Menu attributes<BR>--------------- 
<P></P>
<P>- misc options: "option" &lt;symbol&gt;[=&lt;value&gt;]<BR>&nbsp; Various less common options can be defined via this option syntax,<BR>&nbsp; which can modify the behaviour of the menu entry and its config<BR>&nbsp; symbol. These options are currently possible:</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp; - "defconfig_list"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This declares a list of default entries which can be used when<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for the default configuration (which is used when the main<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .config doesn't exists yet.)</P>
<P>&nbsp; - "modules"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This declares the symbol to be used as the MODULES symbol, which<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enables the third modular state for all config symbols.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At most one symbol may have the "modules" option set.</P>
<P>&nbsp; - "env"=&lt;value&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This imports the environment variable into Kconfig. It behaves like<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a default, except that the value comes from the environment, this<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also means that the behaviour when mixing it with normal defaults is<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undefined at this point. The symbol is currently not exported back<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the build environment (if this is desired, it can be done via<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; another symbol).</P>
<P>&nbsp; - "allnoconfig_y"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This declares the symbol as one that should have the value y when<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using "allnoconfig". Used for symbols that hide other symbols.
