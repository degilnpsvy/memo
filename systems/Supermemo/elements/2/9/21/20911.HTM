Menu attributes<BR>--------------- 
<P></P>
<P>- limiting menu display: "visible if" &lt;expr&gt;<BR><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp; This attribute is only applicable to menu blocks, if the condition is<BR>&nbsp; false, the menu block is not displayed to the user (the symbols<BR>&nbsp; contained there can still be selected by other symbols, though). It is<BR>&nbsp; similar to a conditional "prompt" attribute for individual menu<BR>&nbsp; entries. Default value of "visible" is true.</FONT>
