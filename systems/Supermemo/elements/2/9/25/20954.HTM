--- 3.3 Binary Blobs 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;Some external modules need to include an object file as a blob.<BR>&nbsp;kbuild has support for this, but requires the blob file to be<BR>&nbsp;named &lt;filename&gt;_shipped. When the kbuild rules kick in, a copy<BR>&nbsp;of &lt;filename&gt;_shipped is created with _shipped stripped off,<BR>&nbsp;giving us &lt;filename&gt;. This shortened filename can be used in<BR>&nbsp;the assignment to the module.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;Throughout this section, 8123_bin.o_shipped has been used to<BR>&nbsp;build the kernel module 8123.ko; it has been included as<BR>&nbsp;8123_bin.o.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;8123-y := 8123_if.o 8123_pci.o 8123_bin.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;Although there is no distinction between the ordinary source<BR>&nbsp;files and the binary file, kbuild will pick up different rules<BR>&nbsp;when creating the object file for the module.
