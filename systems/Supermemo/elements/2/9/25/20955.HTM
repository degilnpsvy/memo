--- 3.4 Building Multiple Modules 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;kbuild supports building multiple modules with a single build<BR>&nbsp;file. For example, if you wanted to build two modules, foo.ko<BR>&nbsp;and bar.ko, the kbuild lines would be:</P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>&nbsp;&nbsp;obj-m := foo.o bar.o<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;foo-y := &lt;foo_srcs&gt;<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;bar-y := &lt;bar_srcs&gt;</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;It is that simple!
