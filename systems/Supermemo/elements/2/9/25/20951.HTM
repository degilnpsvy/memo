In the last section we saw the command to build a module for the<BR>running kernel. The module is not actually built, however, because a<BR>build file is required. Contained in this file will be the name of<BR>the module(s) being built, along with the list of requisite source<BR>files. The file may be as simple as a single line: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;obj-m := &lt;module_name&gt;.o</P>
<P>The kbuild system will build &lt;module_name&gt;.o from &lt;module_name&gt;.c,<BR>and, after linking, will result in the kernel module &lt;module_name&gt;.ko.<BR>The above line can be put in either a "Kbuild" file or a "Makefile."<BR>When the module is built from multiple sources, an additional line is<BR>needed listing the files:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;module_name&gt;-y := &lt;src1&gt;.o &lt;src2&gt;.o ...</P>
<P>NOTE: Further documentation describing the syntax used by kbuild is<BR>located in Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt.
