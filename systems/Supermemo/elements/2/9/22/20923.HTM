Kconfig syntax<BR>-------------- 
<P></P>
<P>choices:</P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> 
<P>This defines a choice group and accepts any of the above attributes as<BR>options. A choice can only be of type bool or tristate, while a boolean<BR>choice only allows a single config entry to be selected, a tristate<BR>choice also allows any number of config entries to be set to 'm'. This<BR>can be used if multiple drivers for a single hardware exists and only a<BR>single driver can be compiled/loaded into the kernel, but all drivers<BR>can be compiled as modules.
