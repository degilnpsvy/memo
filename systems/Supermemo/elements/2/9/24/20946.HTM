To build external modules, you must have a prebuilt kernel available<BR>that contains the configuration and header files used in the build.<BR>Also, the kernel must have been built with modules enabled. If you are<BR>using a distribution kernel, there will be a package for the kernel you<BR>are running provided by your distribution. 
<P></P>
<P>An alternative is<FONT class=clozed> to use the "make" target "modules_prepare." This will<BR>make sure the kernel contains the information required. The target<BR>exists solely as a simple way to prepare a kernel source tree for<BR>building external modules.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>NOTE: "modules_prepare" will not build Module.symvers even if<BR>CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is set; therefore, a full kernel build needs to be<BR>executed to make module versioning work</FONT>.
