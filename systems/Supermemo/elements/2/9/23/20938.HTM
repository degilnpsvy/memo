Menu attributes<BR>--------------- 
<P></P>
<P>- default value: "default" &lt;expr&gt; ["if" &lt;expr&gt;]<BR>&nbsp; A config option can have <SPAN class=cloze>[...]how many?</SPAN>.<BR>&nbsp; Default values are not limited to the menu entry where they are<BR>&nbsp; defined. This means the default can be defined somewhere else or be<BR>&nbsp; overridden by an earlier definition.<BR>&nbsp; The default value is only assigned to the config symbol if no other<BR>&nbsp; value was set by the user (via the input prompt above). If an input<BR>&nbsp; prompt is visible the default value is presented to the user and can<BR>&nbsp; be overridden by him.<BR>&nbsp; Optionally, dependencies only for this default value can be added with<BR>&nbsp; "if".
