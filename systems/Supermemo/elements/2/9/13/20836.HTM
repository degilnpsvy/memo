=== 2 Who does what 
<P>People have four different relationships with the kernel Makefiles.</P>
<P>*Users* are people who build kernels.&nbsp; These people type commands such as<BR>"make menuconfig" or "make".&nbsp; They usually do not read or edit<BR>any kernel Makefiles (or any other source files).</P>
<P>*Normal developers* are people who work on features such as device<BR>drivers, file systems, and network protocols.&nbsp; These people need to<BR>maintain the kbuild Makefiles for the subsystem they are<BR>working on.&nbsp; In order to do this effectively, they need some overall<BR>knowledge about the kernel Makefiles, plus detailed knowledge about the<BR>public interface for kbuild.</P>
<P>*Arch developers* are people who work on an entire architecture, such<BR>as sparc or ia64.&nbsp; Arch developers need to know about the arch Makefile<BR>as well as kbuild Makefiles.</P>
<P>*Kbuild developers* are people who work on the kernel build system itself.<BR>These people need to know about all aspects of the kernel Makefiles.</P>
<P>This document is aimed towards normal developers and arch developers.
