<P><FONT class=extract>The Makefiles have five parts:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;Makefile&nbsp;&nbsp;the top Makefile.<BR>&nbsp;.config&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kernel configuration file.<BR>&nbsp;arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile&nbsp;the arch Makefile.<BR>&nbsp;scripts/Makefile.*&nbsp;common rules etc. for all kbuild Makefiles.<BR>&nbsp;kbuild Makefiles&nbsp;there are about 500 of these.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The top Makefile reads the .config file, which comes from the kernel<BR>configuration process.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The top Makefile is responsible for building two major products: vmlinux<BR>(the resident kernel image) and modules (any module files).<BR>It builds these goals by recursively descending into the subdirectories of<BR>the kernel source tree.<BR>The list of subdirectories which are visited depends upon the kernel<BR>configuration. The top Makefile textually includes an arch Makefile<BR>with the name arch/$(ARCH)/Makefile. The arch Makefile supplies<BR>architecture-specific information to the top Makefile.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Each subdirectory has a kbuild Makefile which carries out the commands<BR>passed down from above. The kbuild Makefile uses information from the<BR>.config file to construct various file lists used by kbuild to build<BR>any built-in or modular targets.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>scripts/Makefile.* contains all the definitions/rules etc. that<BR>are used to build the kernel based on the kbuild makefiles.</FONT>
