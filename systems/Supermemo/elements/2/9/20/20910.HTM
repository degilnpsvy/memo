<P>- reverse dependencies: "select" &lt;symbol&gt; ["if" &lt;expr&gt;]<BR>&nbsp; <FONT class=clozed>While normal dependencies reduce the upper limit of a symbol (see<BR>&nbsp; below), reverse dependencies can be used to force a lower limit of<BR>&nbsp; another symbol. The value of the current menu symbol is used as the<BR>&nbsp; minimal value &lt;symbol&gt; can be set to. If &lt;symbol&gt; is selected multiple<BR>&nbsp; times, the limit is set to the largest selection.<BR>&nbsp; Reverse dependencies can only be used with boolean or tristate<BR>&nbsp; symbols.<BR>&nbsp; Note:<BR>&nbsp;select should be used with care. select will force<BR>&nbsp;a symbol to a value without visiting the dependencies.<BR>&nbsp;By abusing select you are able to select a symbol FOO even<BR>&nbsp;if FOO depends on BAR that is not set.<BR>&nbsp;In general use select only for non-visible symbols<BR>&nbsp;(no prompts anywhere) and for symbols with no dependencies.<BR>&nbsp;That will limit the usefulness but on the other hand avoid<BR>&nbsp;the illegal configurations all over.</FONT>
