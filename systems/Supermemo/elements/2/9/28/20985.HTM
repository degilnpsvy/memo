Adding common features and make the usage configurable<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>It is a common idiom to implement a feature/functionality that are<BR>relevant for some architectures but not all.<BR>The recommended way to do so is to use a config variable named HAVE_*<BR>that is defined in a common Kconfig file and selected by the relevant<BR>architectures.<BR>An example is the generic IOMAP functionality. <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> 
<P>Note: we use the existing config option and avoid creating a new<BR>config variable to select HAVE_GENERIC_IOMAP.</P>
<P>Note: the use of the internal config variable HAVE_GENERIC_IOMAP, it is<BR>introduced to overcome the limitation of select which will force a<BR>config option to 'y' no matter the dependencies.<BR>The dependencies are moved to the symbol GENERIC_IOMAP and we avoid the<BR>situation where select forces a symbol equals to 'y'.
