--- 3.5 Library file goals - lib-y 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;Objects listed with obj-* are used for modules, or<BR>&nbsp;combined in a built-in.o for that specific directory.<BR>&nbsp;There is also the possibility to list objects that will<BR>&nbsp;be included in a library, lib.a.<BR>&nbsp;<FONT class=extract>All objects listed with lib-y are combined in a single<BR>&nbsp;library for that directory.<BR></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT class=extract>Objects that are listed in obj-y and additionally listed in<BR>&nbsp;lib-y will not be included in the library, since they will<BR>&nbsp;be accessible anyway.<BR></FONT>&nbsp;<FONT class=extract>For consistency, objects listed in lib-m will be included in lib.a.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;Note that the same kbuild makefile may list files to be built-in<BR>&nbsp;and to be part of a library. Therefore the same directory<BR>&nbsp;may contain both a built-in.o and a lib.a file.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;#arch/x86/lib/Makefile<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;lib-y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; := delay.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;This will create a library lib.a based on delay.o. For kbuild to<BR>&nbsp;actually recognize that there is a lib.a being built, the directory<BR>&nbsp;shall be listed in libs-y.<BR>&nbsp;See also "6.4 List directories to visit when descending".</P>
<P>&nbsp;Use of lib-y is normally restricted to lib/ and arch/*/lib.
