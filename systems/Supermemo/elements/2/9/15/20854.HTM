--- 3.1 Goal definitions 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;Goal definitions are the main part (heart) of the kbuild Makefile.<BR>&nbsp;These lines define the files to be built, any special compilation<BR>&nbsp;options, and any subdirectories to be entered recursively.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The most simple kbuild makefile contains one line:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;obj-y += foo.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;This tells kbuild that there is one object in that directory, named<BR>&nbsp;foo.o. foo.o will be built from foo.c or foo.S.</P>
<P>&nbsp;If foo.o shall be built as a module, the variable obj-m is used.<BR>&nbsp;Therefore the following pattern is often used:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Example:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;obj-$(CONFIG_FOO) += foo.o</P>
<P>&nbsp;$(CONFIG_FOO) evaluates to either y (for built-in) or m (for module).<BR>&nbsp;If CONFIG_FOO is neither y nor m, then the file will not be compiled<BR>&nbsp;nor linked.
