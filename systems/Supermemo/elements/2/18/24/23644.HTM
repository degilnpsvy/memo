<P>match(): Attaching Drivers to Devices<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</P>
<P></P>
<P>The format of device ID structures and the semantics for comparing<BR>them are inherently bus-specific. Drivers typically declare an array<BR>of device IDs of devices they support that reside in a bus-specific<BR>driver structure. </P>
<P>The purpose of the match callback is to give the bus an opportunity to<BR>determine if a particular driver supports a particular device by<BR>comparing the device IDs the driver supports with the device ID of a<BR>particular device, without sacrificing bus-specific functionality or<BR>type-safety. </P>
<P>When a driver is registered with the bus, the bus's list of devices is<BR>iterated over, and the match callback is called for each device that<BR>does not have a driver associated with it.
