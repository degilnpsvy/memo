The feature that distinguishes this type of shared memory region from a System V shared memory object (Chapter 48) is that<FONT class=clozed> modifications to the contents of the region are carried through to the underlying mapped file. This feature is useful in an application that requires the shared memory contents to persist across application or system restarts</FONT>.</SPAN>
