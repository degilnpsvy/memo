The linux kernel has 2 general types of console drivers.&nbsp; 
<P></P>
<P>The first type is<BR><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The second type has to be explicitly loaded and unloaded. This will be called<BR>'modular driver' by this document. Multiple modular drivers can coexist at<BR>any time with each driver sharing the console with other drivers including<BR>the system driver. However, modular drivers cannot take over the console<BR>that is currently occupied by another modular driver. (Exception: Drivers that<BR>call take_over_console() will succeed in the takeover regardless of the type<BR>of driver occupying the consoles.) They can only take over the console that is<BR>occupied by the system driver. In the same token, if the modular driver is<BR>released by the console, the system driver will take over.
