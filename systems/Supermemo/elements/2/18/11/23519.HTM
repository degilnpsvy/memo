The volatile storage class was originally meant for memory-mapped I/O<BR>registers.&nbsp; Within the kernel, register accesses, too, should be protected<BR>by locks, but one also does not want the compiler "optimizing" register<BR>accesses within a critical section.&nbsp; But, within the kernel, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, so, once again, volatile is unnecessary.
