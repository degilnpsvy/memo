It is a *very* good idea to protect kernel data structures with magic<BR>numbers.&nbsp; This allows you to check at run time whether (a) <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, or (b) you've passed the wrong structure to a<BR>routine.&nbsp; This last is especially useful --- particularly when you are<BR>passing pointers to structures via a void * pointer.&nbsp; The tty code,<BR>for example, does this frequently to pass driver-specific and line<BR>discipline-specific structures back and forth.
