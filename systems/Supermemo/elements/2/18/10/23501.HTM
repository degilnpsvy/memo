<P>What is an IRQ?</P>
<P></P>
<P>An IRQ is an interrupt request from a device.<BR>Currently they can come in over a pin, or over a packet.<BR>Several devices may be connected to the same pin thus<BR>sharing an IRQ.</P>
<P>An IRQ number is a kernel identifier used to talk about a hardware<BR>interrupt source.&nbsp; Typically this is an index into the global irq_desc<BR>array, but except for what linux/interrupt.h implements the details<BR>are architecture specific.</P>
<P>An IRQ number is an enumeration of the possible interrupt sources on a<BR>machine.&nbsp; Typically what is enumerated is the number of input pins on<BR>all of the interrupt controller in the system.&nbsp; In the case of ISA<BR>what is enumerated are the 16 input pins on the two i8259 interrupt<BR>controllers.</P>
<P>Architectures can assign additional meaning to the IRQ numbers, and<BR>are encouraged to in the case&nbsp; where there is any manual configuration<BR>of the hardware involved.&nbsp; The ISA IRQs are a classic example of<BR>assigning this kind of additional meaning.
