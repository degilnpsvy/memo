<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cpuidle</P>
<P>General Information:</P>
<P>Various CPUs today support multiple idle levels that are differentiated<BR>by varying exit latencies and power consumption during idle.<BR>cpuidle is a generic in-kernel infrastructure that separates<BR>idle policy (governor) from idle mechanism (driver) and provides a<BR>standardized infrastructure to support independent development of<BR>governors and drivers.</P>
<P>cpuidle resides under drivers/cpuidle.</P>
<P>Boot options:<BR>"cpuidle_sysfs_switch"<BR>enables current_governor interface in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/,<BR>which can be used to switch governors at run time. This boot option<BR>is meant for developer testing only. In normal usage, kernel picks the<BR>best governor based on governor ratings.<BR>SEE ALSO: sysfs.txt in this directory.
