<P>8: FOR MORE INFORMATION</P>
<P></P>
<P>There are numerous sources of information on Linux kernel development and<BR>related topics.&nbsp; First among those will always be the Documentation<BR>directory found in the kernel source distribution.&nbsp; The top-level HOWTO<BR>file is an important starting point; SubmittingPatches and<BR>SubmittingDrivers are also something which all kernel developers should<BR>read.&nbsp; Many internal kernel APIs are documented using the kerneldoc<BR>mechanism; "make htmldocs" or "make pdfdocs" can be used to generate those<BR>documents in HTML or PDF format (though the version of TeX shipped by some<BR>distributions runs into internal limits and fails to process the documents<BR>properly).</P>
<P>Various web sites discuss kernel development at all levels of detail.&nbsp; Your<BR>author would like to humbly suggest <A href="http://lwn.net/">http://lwn.net/</A> as a source;<BR>information on many specific kernel topics can be found via the LWN kernel<BR>index at:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A href="http://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/">http://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/</A></P>
<P>Beyond that, a valuable resource for kernel developers is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A href="http://kernelnewbies.org/">http://kernelnewbies.org/</A></P>
<P>Information about the linux-next tree gathers at:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A href="http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/">http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/</A></P>
<P>And, of course, one should not forget <A href="http://kernel.org/">http://kernel.org/</A>, the definitive<BR>location for kernel release information.</P>
<P>There are a number of books on kernel development:</P>
<P>&nbsp;Linux Device Drivers, 3rd Edition (Jonathan Corbet, Alessandro<BR>&nbsp;Rubini, and Greg Kroah-Hartman).&nbsp; Online at<BR>&nbsp;<A href="http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/">http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/</A>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Linux Kernel Development (Robert Love).</P>
<P>&nbsp;Understanding the Linux Kernel (Daniel Bovet and Marco Cesati).</P>
<P>All of these books suffer from a common fault, though: they tend to be<BR>somewhat obsolete by the time they hit the shelves, and they have been on<BR>the shelves for a while now.&nbsp; Still, there is quite a bit of good<BR>information to be found there.</P>
<P>Documentation for git can be found at:</P>
<P>&nbsp;<A href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/</A></P>

<P><BR>9: CONCLUSION</P>
<P>Congratulations to anybody who has made it through this long-winded<BR>document.&nbsp; Hopefully it has provided a helpful understanding of how the<BR>Linux kernel is developed and how you can participate in that process.</P>
<P>In the end, it's the participation that matters.&nbsp; Any open source software<BR>project is no more than the sum of what its contributors put into it.&nbsp; The<BR>Linux kernel has progressed as quickly and as well as it has because it has<BR>been helped by an impressively large group of developers, all of whom are<BR>working to make it better.&nbsp; The kernel is a premier example of what can be<BR>done when thousands of people work together toward a common goal.</P>
<P>The kernel can always benefit from a larger developer base, though.&nbsp; There<BR>is always more work to do.&nbsp; But, just as importantly, most other<BR>participants in the Linux ecosystem can benefit through contributing to the<BR>kernel.&nbsp; Getting code into the mainline is the key to higher code quality,<BR>lower maintenance and distribution costs, a higher level of influence over<BR>the direction of kernel development, and more.&nbsp; It is a situation where<BR>everybody involved wins.&nbsp; Fire up your editor and come join us; you will be<BR>more than welcome.
