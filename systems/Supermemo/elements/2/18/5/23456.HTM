This is more complicated in the case of the framebuffer console (fbcon),<BR>because fbcon is an intermediate layer between the console and the drivers: 
<P></P>
<P>console ---&gt;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> ---&gt; hardware</P>
<P>The fbdev drivers cannot be unloaded if it's bound to fbcon, and fbcon cannot<BR>be unloaded if it's bound to the console layer.</P>
<P>So to unload the fbdev drivers, one must first unbind fbcon from the console,<BR>then unbind the fbdev drivers from fbcon.&nbsp; Fortunately, unbinding fbcon from<BR>the console layer will automatically unbind framebuffer drivers from<BR>fbcon. Thus, there is no need to explicitly unbind the fbdev drivers from<BR>fbcon.
