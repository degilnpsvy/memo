In addition, modifications to the contents of the mapping are carried through to the file. In effect, the file is being treated as the paging store for this region of memory, as shown in Figure 49-2. (We simplify things in this diagram by omitting to show that the mapped pages are typically not contiguous in physical memory.)</SPAN>
