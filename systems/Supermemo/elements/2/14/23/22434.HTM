Devices<BR>~~~~~~~<BR><FONT class=extract>As devices are bound to drivers, they are added to the device class<BR>that the driver belongs to. Before the driver model core, this would<BR>typically happen during the driver's probe() callback, once the device<BR>has been initialized. It now happens after the probe() callback<BR>finishes from the core.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The device is enumerated in the class. Each time a device is added to<BR>the class, the class's devnum field is incremented and assigned to the<BR>device. The field is never decremented, so if the device is removed<BR>from the class and re-added, it will receive a different enumerated<BR>value. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The class is allowed to create a class-specific structure for the<BR>device and store it in the device's class_data pointer. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>There is no list of devices in the device class. Each driver has a<BR>list of devices that it supports. The device class has a list of<BR>drivers of that particular class. To access all of the devices in the<BR>class, iterate over the device lists of each driver in the class.</FONT></P>
