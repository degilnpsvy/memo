The above abstraction (bus, device, class ...)&nbsp;prevents unnecessary pain during transitional phases.<BR>If it were not done this way, then when a field was renamed or removed, every<BR>downstream driver would break.&nbsp; On the other hand, if only the bus layer<BR>(and not the device layer) accesses the struct device, it is only the bus<BR>layer that needs to change.
