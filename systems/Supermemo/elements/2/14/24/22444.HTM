The PCI bus layer freely accesses the fields of struct device. It knows about<BR>the structure of struct pci_dev, and it should know the structure of struct<BR>device. Individual PCI device drivers that have been converted to the current<BR>driver model generally do not and should not touch the fields of struct device,<BR>unless there is a compelling reason to do so.
