&nbsp;- Booting a kernel directly from a floppy without the assistance of a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; bootloader such as LILO, is no longer supported.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you boot Linux from the hard drive, chances are you use LILO, which<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; uses the kernel image as specified in the file /etc/lilo.conf.&nbsp; The<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; kernel image file is usually /vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz, /bzImage or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; /boot/bzImage.&nbsp; To use the new kernel, save a copy of the old image<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; and copy the new image over the old one.&nbsp; Then, you MUST RERUN LILO<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; to update the loading map!! If you don't, you won't be able to boot<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; the new kernel image.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstalling LILO is usually a matter of running /sbin/lilo. <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; You may wish to edit /etc/lilo.conf to specify an entry for your<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; old kernel image (say, /vmlinux.old) in case the new one does not<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; work.&nbsp; See the LILO docs for more information. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After reinstalling LILO, you should be all set.&nbsp; Shutdown the system,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; reboot, and enjoy!</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ever need to change the default root device, video mode,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; ramdisk size, etc.&nbsp; in the kernel image, use the 'rdev' program (or<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; alternatively the LILO boot options when appropriate).&nbsp; No need to<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; recompile the kernel to change these parameters.
