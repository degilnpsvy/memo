&nbsp;- Keep a backup kernel handy in case something goes wrong.&nbsp; This is <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; especially true for the development releases, since each new release<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; contains new code which has not been debugged.&nbsp; Make sure you keep a<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; backup of the modules corresponding to that kernel, as well.&nbsp; If you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; are installing a new kernel with the same version number as your<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; working kernel, make a backup of your modules directory before you<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; do a "make modules_install".

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, before compiling, use the kernel config option<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; "<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>" to append a unique suffix to the regular kernel version.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;
