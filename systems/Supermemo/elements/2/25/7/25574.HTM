<P class=docText>Another registered protocol family often found in boot messages is <TT>AF_NETLINK</TT><A name="sockets offer"></A> (Family 16). Netlink sockets offer a method to communicate between user processes and the kernel. Functionalities accomplished via netlink sockets include accessing the routing table and the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Address Resolution Protocol</SPAN> (ARP) table (see <SPAN class=docEmphasis>include/linux/netlink.h</SPAN><A name="than system"></A> for the full usage list). Netlink sockets are more suitable than system calls to accomplish such tasks because they are asynchronous, simpler to implement, and dynamically linkable.
