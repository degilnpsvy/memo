<P>/*<BR>&nbsp;* Generic wait-for-completion handler;<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* It differs from semaphores in that their default case is the opposite,<BR>&nbsp;* wait_for_completion default blocks whereas semaphore default non-block. The<BR>&nbsp;* interface also makes it easy to 'complete' multiple waiting threads,<BR>&nbsp;* something which isn't entirely natural for semaphores.<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* But more importantly, the primitive documents the usage. <FONT class=extract>Semaphores would<BR>&nbsp;* typically be used for exclusion which gives rise to priority inversion.<BR>&nbsp;* Waiting for completion is a typically sync point, but not an exclusion point.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;*/
