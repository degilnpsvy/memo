like we do device_register(). First,<BR>&nbsp;* we remove it from all the subsystems with device_del(), then<BR>&nbsp;* we decrement the reference count via put_device(). If that<BR>&nbsp;* is the final reference count, the device will be cleaned up<BR>&nbsp;* via device_release() above. Otherwise, the structure will<BR>&nbsp;* stick around until the final reference to the device is dropped.
