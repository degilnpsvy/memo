/**<BR>&nbsp;* device_unregister - unregister device from system.<BR>&nbsp;* @dev: device going away.<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* We do this in two parts, <FONT class=clozed>like we do device_register(). First,<BR>&nbsp;* we remove it from all the subsystems with device_del(), then<BR>&nbsp;* we decrement the reference count via put_device(). If that<BR>&nbsp;* is the final reference count, the device will be cleaned up<BR>&nbsp;* via device_release() above. Otherwise, the structure will<BR>&nbsp;* stick around until the final reference to the device is dropped.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;*/
