/*<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;These inlines deal with timer wrapping correctly. You are <BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;strongly encouraged to use them<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;1. Because people otherwise forget<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;2. Because if the timer wrap changes in future you won't have to<BR>&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alter your driver code.<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* time_after(a,b) returns true if the time a is after time b.<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* Do this with "&lt;0" and "&gt;=0" to only test the sign of the result. A<BR>&nbsp;* good compiler would generate better code (and a really good compiler<BR>&nbsp;* wouldn't care).
