Strictly speaking, the prototypes are <FONT class=clozed>optional</FONT> for some functions. If no prototype is specified, the C compiler assumes the function returns an int and takes any number of parameters. Omitting a prototype robs the C compiler of valuable information that it can use to check function calls. Most compilers have a compile-time switch that warns the programmer about function calls without prototypes.
