<TD>Every TB can goto_tb to max two other different destinations. There are 
<P>two jump slots. tcg_gen_goto_tb takes a jump slot index as an arg, 0 or 1. These jumps will only take place if the TB's get chained, you need to tcg_gen_exit_tb with (tb | index) for that to ever happen. tcg_gen_goto_tb may be issued at most once with each slot index per TB. </P></TD></TR>

<TD><TT>tcg_gen_exit_tb(num);</TT> </TD>
<TD>Exit translation block </TD>
<TD>num may be 0 or TB address ORed with the index of the taken jump slot. 
<P>If you tcg_gen_exit_tb(0), chaining will not happen and a new TB will be looked up based on the CPU state. </P></TD></TR>
