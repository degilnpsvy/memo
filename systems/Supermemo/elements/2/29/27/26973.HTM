<P>Often times, target insns cannot be broken down into one or two simple RISC insns which means temporary registers might be necessary to store intermediate results. Rather than each frontend maintaining its own static set of temporary scratch registers, helpers are provided to manage these on the fly. </P>

<P>You should not try to "hold on" to temporary registers beyond the target insn you're currently generating. If you need long lived registers, consider allocating a proper one.
