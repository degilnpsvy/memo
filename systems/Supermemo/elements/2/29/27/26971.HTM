<LI>When the term <I>register</I> is used unqualified, it most likely is referring to a TCG register. </LI></UL>

<LI><FONT class=extract>The frontend helpers for generating TCG opcodes typically take the form: <TT>tcg_gen_<I>&lt;op&gt;[i]</I>_<I>&lt;reg_size&gt;</I></TT>. </FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The <I>&lt;op&gt;</I> is the TCG operation that will be generated for its arguments. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The <I>[i]</I> suffix is used to indicate the TCG operation takes an </FONT><A title=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_(programming) class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_%28programming%29" rel=nofollow><FONT class=extract>immediate</FONT></A><FONT class=extract> rather than a normal register. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The <I>&lt;reg_size&gt;</I> refers to the size of the TCG registers in use. The vast majority of the time, this will match the native size of the emulated target, so rather than force people to type <I>i32</I> or <I>i64</I> all the time, the shorthand <I>tl</I> is made available for all helpers. e.g. to perform a 32bit register move for a 32bit target, simply use <I>tcg_gen_mov_tl</I> rather than <I>tcg_gen_mov_i32</I>.</FONT> </LI></UL></LI></UL>

<LI>We won't cover the immediate variants of functions as their usage should be fairly obvious once you grasp the register version. </LI></UL>

<LI>To keep things simple, we'll cover the <I>tl</I> variants here. If you need to delve into explicit types, then you should probably know what you're doing anyways, so you're beyond the current scope of this wiki page. </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI>Similarly, rather than using <I>TCGv_i32</I> and <I>TCGv_i64</I> everywhere, people should stick to <I>TCGv</I> and <I>TCGv_ptr</I>. </LI></UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The <TT>tcg_gen_xxx</TT> arguments typically place the return value first followed by the operands. So to add two registers (<TT>a = b + c</TT>), the code would be <TT>tcg_gen_xxx(a, b, c);</TT>.</FONT> </LI></UL>
