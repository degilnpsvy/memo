Other notes: 
<P></P>
<P>- <FONT class=extract>Writing causes the show() method to be rearmed regardless of current<BR>&nbsp; file position.</FONT></P>
<P>- <FONT class=extract>The buffer will always be PAGE_SIZE bytes in length. On i386, this<BR>&nbsp; is 4096.</FONT> </P>
<P>- <FONT class=extract>show() methods should return the number of bytes printed into the<BR>&nbsp; buffer. This is the return value of scnprintf().</FONT></P>
<P>- <FONT class=extract>show() should always use scnprintf().</FONT></P>
<P>- <FONT class=extract>store() should return the number of bytes used from the buffer. If the<BR>&nbsp; entire buffer has been used, just return the count argument.</FONT></P>
<P>- show() or store() can always return errors. If a bad value comes<BR>&nbsp; through, be sure to return an error.</P>
<P>- The object passed to the methods will be pinned in memory via sysfs<BR>&nbsp; referencing counting its embedded object. However, the physical <BR>&nbsp; entity (e.g. device) the object represents may not be present. Be <BR>&nbsp; sure to have a way to check this, if necessary.
