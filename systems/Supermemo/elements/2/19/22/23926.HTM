It's mounted as the initial root filesystem after the kernel boots, to hold additional dynamically <A name=iddle1319></A><A name=iddle2036></A><A name=iddle2060></A><A name=iddle2067></A><A name=iddle2319></A><A name=iddle2362></A><A name=iddle2543></A><A name=iddle3009></A><A name=iddle3010></A><A name=iddle3841></A><A name="that holds"></A>loadable modules required to mount the disk partition that holds the actual root filesystem. Because the kernel runs on different hardware platforms that use diverse storage controllers, it's not feasible for distributions to enable device drivers for all possible disk drives in the base kernel image. Drivers specific to your system's storage device are packed inside initrd and loaded after the kernel boots, but before the root filesystem is mounted. To create an initrd image, use the <TT>mkinitrd</TT> command.
