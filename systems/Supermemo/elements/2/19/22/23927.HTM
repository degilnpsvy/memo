<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>The 2.6 kernel includes a feature called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>initramfs</SPAN></FONT><A name="disk "></A><FONT class=extract> that bring several benefits over initrd.</FONT> Whereas the latter emulates a disk (hence called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>initramdisk</SPAN><A name=or></A> or <SPAN class=docEmphasis>initrd</SPAN><A name="the overheads"></A>) and suffers the overheads associated with the Linux block I/O subsystem such as caching, the former essentially gets the cache itself mounted like a filesystem (hence called <SPAN class=docEmphasis>initramfs</SPAN>).</P>
<P class=docText><A name="the page"></A>Initramfs, like the page cache over which it's built, grows and shrinks dynamically unlike initrd and, hence, reduces memory wastage. Also, unlike initrd, which requires you to include the associated filesystem driver (e.g., EXT2 drivers if you have an EXT2 filesystem on your initrd), initramfs needs no filesystem support. The initramfs code is tiny because it's just a small layer on top of the page cache.
