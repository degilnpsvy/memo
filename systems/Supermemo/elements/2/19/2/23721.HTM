Access<BR>~~~~~~ 
<P></P>
<P>Once the object has been registered, it may access the common fields of<BR>the object, like the lock and the list of devices. </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>;</P>
<P>The devices field is a list of all the devices that have been bound to<BR>the driver. The LDM core provides a helper function to operate on all<BR>the devices a driver controls. This helper locks the driver on each<BR>node access, and does proper reference counting on each device as it<BR>accesses it.
