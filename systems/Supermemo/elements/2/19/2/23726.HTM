unbind a driver from a device. This may be<BR>called if a device is physically removed from the system, if the<BR>driver module is being unloaded, during a reboot sequence, or<BR>in other cases. 
<P></P>
<P>It is up to the driver to determine if the device is present or<BR>not. It should free any resources allocated specifically for the<BR>device; i.e. anything in the device's driver_data field. </P>
<P>If the device is still present, it should quiesce the device and place<BR>it into a supported low-power state.
