The <FONT class=clozed>platform_device.dev.bus_id</FONT> is the canonical name for the devices.<BR>It's built from two components: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <FONT class=clozed>platform_device.name</FONT> ... which is also used to for <FONT class=clozed>driver matching</FONT>.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> ... the device instance number, or else "-1"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to indicate there's only one.</P>
<P>These are concatenated, so name/id "serial"/0 indicates bus_id "serial.0", and<BR>"serial/3" indicates bus_id "serial.3"; both would use the platform_driver<BR>named "serial".&nbsp; While "my_rtc"/-1 would be bus_id "my_rtc" (no instance id)<BR>and use the platform_driver called "my_rtc".
