The first-level kernel initializations are done in real mode assembly. Subsequent startup is performed in protected mode by the function <TT><FONT class=clozed>start_kernel()</FONT></TT> defined in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>init/main.c</SPAN><A name="the previous"></A>, the source file you modified in the previous chapter. <TT>start_kernel()</TT><A name="management are"></A> begins by initializing the CPU subsystem. Memory and process management are put in place soon after. Peripheral buses and I/O devices are started next.
