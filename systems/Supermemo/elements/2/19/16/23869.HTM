<P class=docText><A name="user applications"></A><FONT class=extract>The Linux socket layer is a uniform interface through which user applications access various networking protocols. Each protocol registers itself with the socket layer using a unique family number (defined in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>include/linux/socket.h</SPAN></FONT><A name="assigned to"></A><FONT class=extract>) assigned to it. Family 2 in the preceding message stands for <TT>AF_INET</TT> (Internet Protocol).</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><A name="protocol family"></A><FONT class=extract>Another registered protocol family often found in boot messages is <TT>AF_NETLINK</TT></FONT><A name="sockets offer"></A><FONT class=extract> (Family 16). Netlink sockets offer a method to communicate between user processes and the kernel. Functionalities accomplished via netlink sockets include accessing the routing table and the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>Address Resolution Protocol</SPAN> (ARP) table (see <SPAN class=docEmphasis>include/linux/netlink.h</SPAN></FONT><A name="than system"></A><FONT class=extract> for the full usage list). Netlink sockets are more suitable than system calls to accomplish such tasks because they are asynchronous, simpler to implement, and dynamically linkable.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><A name="in the"></A><FONT class=extract>Another protocol family commonly enabled in the kernel is <TT>AF_UNIX</TT></FONT><A name="interprocess communication"></A><FONT class=extract> or UNIX-domain sockets. Programs such as X Windows use them for interprocess communication on the same system.</FONT>
