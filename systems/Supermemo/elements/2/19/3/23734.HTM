Platform drivers register themselves the normal way: </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>; </P>
<P>Or, in common situations where the device is known not to be hot-pluggable,<BR>the probe() routine can live in an init section to reduce the driver's<BR>runtime memory footprint:</P>
<P>&nbsp;int platform_driver_probe(struct platform_driver *drv,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int (*probe)(struct platform_device *))
