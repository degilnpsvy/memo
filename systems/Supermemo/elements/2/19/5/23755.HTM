All this hardware abstraction makes the implementation of application programs<BR>easier and more portable. E.g. the X server works completely on <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> and<BR>thus doesn't need to know, for example, how the color registers of the concrete<BR>hardware are organized. XF68_FBDev is a general X server for bitmapped,<BR>unaccelerated video hardware. The only thing that has to be built into<BR>application programs is the screen organization (bitplanes or chunky pixels<BR>etc.), because it works on the frame buffer image data directly.
