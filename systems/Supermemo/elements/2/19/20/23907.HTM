<FONT class=extract>The 32-bit <TT>jiffies</TT> variable overflows in approximately 50 days, assuming a <TT>HZ</TT></FONT><A name="that duration"></A><FONT class=extract> value of 1000.</FONT> Because system uptimes can be many times that duration, the kernel provides a variable called <TT>jiffies_64</TT> to hold 64-bit (<TT>u64</TT>) <TT>jiffies</TT>. The linker positions <TT>jiffies_64</TT><A name="collocate with"></A> such that its bottom 32 bits collocate with <TT>jiffies</TT>. On 32-bit machines, the compiler needs two instructions to assign one <TT>u64</TT> variable to another, so reading <TT>jiffies_64</TT><A name="a function"></A> is not atomic. To get around this problem, the kernel provides a function, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. Look at <TT>cpufreq_stats_update()</TT> defined in <SPAN class=docEmphasis>drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_stats.c</SPAN> for a usage example.
