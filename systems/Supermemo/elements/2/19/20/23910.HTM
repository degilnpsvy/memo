Choosing a value for <TT>HZ</TT> is a trade-off. A large <TT>HZ</TT><A name="hence better"></A> results in finer timer granularity, and hence better scheduling resolution. However, bigger values of <TT>HZ</TT><A name="more cycles"></A> also result in larger overhead and higher power consumption, because more cycles are burnt in the timer interrupt context.
