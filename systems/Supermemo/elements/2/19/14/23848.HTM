A device is removed from the core when its reference count goes to<BR>0. The reference count can be adjusted using: 
<P><FONT class=clozed></FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>struct device * get_device(struct device * dev);<BR>void put_device(struct device * dev);</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>get_device() will return a pointer to the struct device passed to it<BR>if the reference is not already 0 (if it's in the process of being<BR>removed already)</FONT>.
