As before, because the size of the mapping is not a multiple of the system page size, it is rounded up. However, in this case, while the bytes in the rounded-up region (i.e., bytes 2200 to 4095 in the diagram) are accessible, they are not mapped to the underlying file (since no corresponding bytes exist in the file). Instead, they are initialized to 0 (SUSv3 requires this). These bytes will <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style='FONT-SIZE: 18pt; FONT-FAMILY: "NewBaskervilleEF-Roman","sans-serif"; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: NewBaskervilleEF-Roman; mso-font-kerning: 0pt'>.</SPAN>
