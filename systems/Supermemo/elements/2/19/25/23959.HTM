<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>The task of the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>pdflush</SPAN></FONT><A name="page cache"></A><FONT class=extract> kernel thread is to flush out dirty pages from the page cache.</FONT> The page cache buffers accesses to the disk. To improve performance, actual writes to the disk are delayed until the pdflush daemon writes out dirtied data to disk. This is done if the available free memory dips below a threshold, or if the page has remained dirty for a sufficiently long time. In 2.4 kernels, these two tasks were respectively performed by separate kernel threads, <SPAN class=docEmphasis>bdflush</SPAN><A name=and></A> and <SPAN class=docEmphasis>kupdated.</SPAN><A name="have noticed"></A> You might have noticed two instances of pdflush in the ps output. A new instance is created if the kernel senses that existing instances have their hands full, servicing disk queues. This improves throughput, especially if your system has multiple disks and many of them are busy.
