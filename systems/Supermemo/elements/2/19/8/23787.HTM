<P>The driver registers the structure on startup. For drivers that have<BR>no bus-specific fields (i.e. don't have a bus-specific driver<BR>structure), they would use driver_register and pass a pointer to their<BR>struct device_driver object. </P>
<P>Most drivers, however, will have a bus-specific structure and will<BR>need to register with the bus using something like pci_driver_register.</P>
<P>It is important that drivers register their driver structure as early as<BR>possible. Registration with the core initializes several fields in the<BR>struct device_driver object, including the reference count and the<BR>lock. These fields are assumed to be valid at all times and may be<BR>used by the device model core or the bus driver.
