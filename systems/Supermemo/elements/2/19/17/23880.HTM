<P class=docText><TT>jiffies</TT> is defined as <SPAN class=docEmphasis><FONT class=clozed>volatile</FONT></SPAN><A name="optimize access"></A>, which asks the compiler not to optimize access to the variable. This ensures that <TT>jiffies</TT><A name="during each"></A>, which is updated by the timer interrupt handler during each tick, is reread during each pass through the loop.
