Driver binding is performed automatically by the driver core, invoking<BR>driver probe() after finding a match between device and driver.&nbsp; If the<BR>probe() succeeds, the driver and device are bound as usual.&nbsp; There are<BR>three different ways to find such a match: 
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Whenever a device is registered, the drivers for that bus are<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checked for matches.&nbsp; Platform devices should be registered very<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; early during system boot.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When a driver is registered using platform_driver_register(), all<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound devices on that bus are checked for matches.&nbsp; Drivers<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usually register later during booting, or by module loading.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Registering a driver using platform_driver_probe() works just like<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using platform_driver_register(), except that the driver won't<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be probed later if another device registers.&nbsp; (Which is OK, since<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this interface is only for use with non-hotpluggable devices.)
