Platform devices<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Platform devices are devices that typically appear as autonomous<BR>entities in the system. This includes legacy port-based devices and<BR>host bridges to peripheral buses, and most controllers integrated<BR>into system-on-chip platforms.&nbsp; What they usually have in common<BR>is direct addressing from a CPU bus.&nbsp; Rarely, a platform_device will<BR>be connected through a segment of some other kind of bus; but its<BR>registers will still be directly addressable. 
<P></P>
<P>Platform devices are given a name, used in driver binding, and a<BR>list of resources such as addresses and IRQs.</P>
