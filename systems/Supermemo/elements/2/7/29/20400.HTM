<P>The premier unit testing framework for C++; you can also use it to test C code. It is stable, actively developed, and has a GUI interface. The primary reasons not to use CppUnit for C are first that it is quite big, and second you have to write your tests in C++, which means you need a C++ compiler. If these don&#8217;t sound like concerns, it is definitely worth considering, along with other C++ unit testing frameworks.
