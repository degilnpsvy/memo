The author designed Check around Autoconf/Automake (thus the name Check:<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE>make check</CODE><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>is the idiom used for testing with Autoconf/Automake), and the test failure messages thrown up by Check use the common idiom of &#8216;<SAMP>filename:linenumber:message</SAMP>&#8217; used by<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE>gcc</CODE><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>and family to report problems in source code. With (X)Emacs, the output of Check allows one to quickly navigate to the location of the unit test that failed; presumably that also works in VI and IDEs.
