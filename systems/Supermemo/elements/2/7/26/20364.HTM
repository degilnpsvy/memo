Subsystem initialization is ref-counted, you must call SDL_QuitSubSystem() for each SDL_InitSubSystem() to correctly shutdown a subsystem manually (or call <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> to force shutdown). 
<P></P>
<P>If a subsystem is already loaded then this call (SDL_InitSubSystem) will increase the ref-count and return.
