Obscure Error Messages </P>
<P>Git tries hard to determine the author of each commit. If you haven&#8217;t set up your name and email address in a way that Git can find it, you may encounter some odd warnings. But there is no need to have an existential crisis if you see a cryptic error message like one of these: </P>
<P>You don't exist. Go away! </P>
<P>Your parents must have hated you! </P>
<P>Your sysadmin must hate you!</P>
<P>The error indicates that Git is unable to determine your real name, likely due to a problem (existence, readability, length) with your Unix &#8220;gecos&#8221; information. The problem can be fixed by setting your name and email configuration information as described in &#8220;Configuring the Commit Author&#8221; on page 24.
