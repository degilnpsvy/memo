Viewing Commit Differences 
<P></P>
<P>To see the differences between the two revisions of index.html, recall both full commit ID names and run git diff: </P>
<P>$ git diff 9da581d910c9c4ac93557ca4859e767f5caf5169&nbsp;ec232cddfb94e0dfd5b5855af8ded7f5eb5c90d6</P>
<P>diff --git a/index.html b/index.html </P>
<P>index 34217e9..8638631 100644</P>
<P>--- a/index.html </P>
<P>+++ b/index.html </P>
<P>@@ -1 +1,5 @@ </P>
<P>+html </P>
<P>+body </P>
<P>My web site is alive! </P>
<P>+/body </P>
<P>+/html</P>
<P>This output should look familiar: It resembles what the diff program produces. As is the convention, the first revision named, 9da581d910c9c4ac93557ca4859e767f5caf5169, is the earlier version of the content and the second revision, named ec232cddfb94e0dfd5b5855af8ded7f5eb5c90d6 is the newer one. Thus, a plus sign (+) precedes each line of new content.</P>
<P>Scared yet? Don&#8217;t worry about those intimidating hex numbers. Thankfully, Git provides many shorter, easier ways to do commands like this without having to produce large complicated numbers.
