<FONT class=extract>All instructions are 32 bits long: </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>That means that no instruction can fit into only two or three bytes of memory (so MIPS binaries are typically 20 percent to 30 percent bigger than for 680x0 or 80x86) and no instruction can be bigger. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>It follows that it is impossible to incorporate a 32-bit constant into a single instruction (there would be no instruction bits left to encode the operation and the target register). The MIPS architects decided to make space for a 26-bit constant to encode the target address of a jump or jump to subroutine; but that&#8217;s only for a couple of instructions. Other instructions find room only for a 16-bit constant. It follows that loading an arbitrary 32-bit value requires a two-instruction sequence, and conditional branches are limited to a range of 64-K instructions.</FONT>
