No condition codes: </P>
<P>One feature of the MIPS instruction set that is radical even among the 1985 RISCs is the lack of any condition flags. Many architectures have multiple flags for &#8220;carry,&#8221; &#8220;zero,&#8221; and so on. CISC architectures typically set these flags according to the result written by any or a large subset of machine instructions, while some RISC architectures retain flags (though typically they are only set explicitly, by compare instructions). The MIPS architects decided to keep all this information in the register file: Compare instructions set general-purpose registers and conditional branch instructions test general-purpose registers. That does benefit a pipelined implementation, in that whatever clever mechanisms are built in to reduce the effect of dependencies on arithmetical/logical operations will also reduce dependencies in compare/branch pairs.
