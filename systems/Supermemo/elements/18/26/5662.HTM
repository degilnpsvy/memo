Instruction actions must fit the pipeline: </P>
<P>Actions can only be carried out in the right pipeline phase and must be complete in one clock. For example, the register write-back phase provides for just one value to be stored in the register file, so instructions can only change one register. Integer multiply and divide instructions are too important to leave out but can&#8217;t be done in one clock. MIPS CPUs have traditionally provided them by dispatching these operations into a separately pipelined unit we&#8217;ll talk about later.
