Three-operand instructions: </P>
<P>Arithmetical/logical operations don&#8217;t have to specify memory locations, so there are plenty of instruction bits to define two independent sources and one destination register. Compilers love three-operand instructions, which give optimizers much more scope to improve code that handles complex expressions.
