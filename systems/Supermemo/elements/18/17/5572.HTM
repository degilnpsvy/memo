Octopus merges </P>
<P>The main reasons why Git supports merging multiple branches together all at once are generality and design elegance. In Git, a commit can have no parents (the initial commit), one parent (a normal commit), or more than one parent (a merge commit). Once you have more than one parent, there is no particular reason to limit that number to only two, so Git data structures support multiple parents.( 2. That&#8217;s the &#8220;Zero, One, or Infinity Principle&#8221; at work. ) The octopus merge strategy is a natural consequence of the general design decision to allow a flexible list of commit parents. </P>
<P>Octopus merges look nice in diagrams, so Git users tend to use them as often as possible. You can just imagine the rush of endorphins a developer gets when merging six branches of a program into one. Besides looking pretty, octopus merges don&#8217;t actually do anything extra. You could just as easily make multiple merge commits, one per branch, and accomplish exactly the same thing.
