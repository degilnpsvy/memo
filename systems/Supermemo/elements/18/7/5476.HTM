The initial state is shown in Figure 5-1. Here, the working directory contains two files named file1 and file2, with contents &#8220;foo&#8221; and &#8220;bar,&#8221; respectively. </P>
<P>In addition to file1 and file2 in the working directory, the master branch has a commit that records a tree with exactly the same &#8220;foo&#8221; and &#8220;bar,&#8221; contents for files file1 and file2. Furthermore, the index records SHA1 values a23bf and 9d3a2 (respectively) for exactly those same file contents. The working directory, the index, and the object store are all synchronized and in agreement. Nothing is dirty.
