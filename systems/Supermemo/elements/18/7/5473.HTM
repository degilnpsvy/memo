Problems with Tracking a Rename </P>
<P>Tracking the renaming of a file engenders a perennial debate among developers of VCSs. A simple rename is fodder enough for dissension. The argument becomes even more heated when the file&#8217;s name changes and then its content changes. Then the scenarios turn the parley from practical to philosophical: Is that &#8220;new&#8221; file really a rename, or is it merely similar to the old one? How similar should the new file be before it&#8217;s considered the same file? If you apply someone&#8217;s patch that deletes a file and recreates a similar one elsewhere, how is that managed? What happens if a file is renamed in two different ways on two different branches? Is it less error prone to automatically detect renames in such a situation, as Git does, or to require the user to explicitly identify renames, as SVN does? </P>
<P>In real life use, it seems that Git&#8217;s system for handling file renames is superior, because there are just too many ways for a file to be renamed and humans are simply not smart enough to make sure SVN knows about them all. But there is no perfect system for handling renames ... yet.
