Preparing for a Merge 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Before you begin a merge, it&#8217;s best to tidy up your working directory.</FONT> During a normal merge, Git creates new versions of files and places them in your working directory when it is finished. Furthermore, Git also uses the index to store temporary and intermediate versions of files during the operation. </P>
<P>If you have modified files in your working directory or if you&#8217;ve modified the index via git add or git rm, then your repository has a dirty working directory or index. If you start a merge in a dirty state, Git may be unable to combine the changes from all the branches and from those in your working directory or index in one pass.</P>
<P>You don&#8217;t have to start with a clean directory. Git performs the merge, for example, if the files affected by the merge operation and the dirty files in your working directory are disjoint. However, as a general rule, your Git life will be much easier if you start each merge with a clean working directory and index.
