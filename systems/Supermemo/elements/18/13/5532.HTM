Checking out Branches </P>
<P>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, your working directory can reflect only one branch at a time. To start working on a different branch, issue the git checkout command. Given a branch name, git checkout makes the branch the new, current working branch. It changes your working tree file and directory structure to match the state of the given branch. However, as you&#8217;ll see, Git builds in safeguards to keep you from losing data you haven&#8217;t yet committed. </P>
<P>In addition, git checkout gives you access to all states of the repository going back from the tip of the branch to the beginning of the project. This is because, as you may recall from Chapter 6, each commit captures a snapshot of the complete repository state at a given moment in time.
