In MIPS implementations, a multiply takes 4&#8211;10 cycles, but divide may take 15&#8211;30. By dividing these long-latency instructions into two stages <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>the instruction set encourages the use of a multiply machine separately pipelined from the regular integer unit. Later CPUs provided a richer set of instructions, including multiply-accumulate instructions, which give software different ways of exploiting the pipeline&#8212;see section 8.5.5 for details.
