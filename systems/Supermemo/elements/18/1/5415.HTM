Here&#8217;s what a MIPS CPU does when it decides to take an exception: 
<P></P>
<P>1. It sets up EPC to point to the restart location. </P>
<P>2. <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze></SPAN>3. Cause is set up so that software can see the reason for the exception. On address exceptions, BadVAddr is also set. Memory management system exceptions set up some of the MMU registers too; more details are given in Chapter 6. </P>
<P>4. The CPU then starts fetching instructions from the exception entry point, and everything else is up to software<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Minion-Regular-0-1000-20; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Minion-Regular-0-1000-20">.</SPAN>
