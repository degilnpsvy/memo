The MIPS exception mechanism is general purpose, but democratically speaking there are two exception types that happen far more often than all the rest put together. One is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>; we mentioned that before and will come back to it in Chapter 6. The other popular exceptions are interrupts, occurring when a device outside the CPU wants attention. Since we&#8217;re dealing with an outside world that won&#8217;t wait for us, interrupt service time is often critical.
