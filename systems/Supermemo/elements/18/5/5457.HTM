How Do We Know a SHA1 Hash Is Unique? </P>
<P>There is an extremely slim chance that two different blobs yield the same SHA1 hash. When this happens, it is called a collision. However, a SHA1 collision is so unlikely that you can safely bank on it never interfering with our use of Git. </P>
<P>SHA1 is a &#8220;cryptographically secure hash.&#8221; Until recently, there was no known way (better than blind luck) for a user to cause a collision on purpose. But could a collision happen at random? Let&#8217;s see.</P>
<P>With 160 bits, you have 2^160 or about 10^48 (1 with 48 zeroes after it) possible SHA1 hashes. That number is just incomprehensibly huge. Even if you hired a trillion people to produce a trillion new unique blobs per second for a trillion years, you would still only have about 10^43 blobs.</P>
<P>If you hashed 2^80 random blobs, you might find a collision. Don&#8217;t trust us. Go read Bruce Schneier.
