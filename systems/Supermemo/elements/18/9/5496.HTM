Figure 6-4 shows the same commit graph as Figure 6-3 but without depicting the tree and blob objects. Usually for the purpose of discussion or reference, branch names are also shown in the commit graphs.

<P>In the field of computer science, a graph is a collection of nodes and a set of edges between the nodes. There are several types of graphs with different properties. <FONT class=extract>Git makes use of a special graph called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). A DAG has two important properties. First, the edges within the graph are all directed from one node to another. Second, starting at any node in the graph, there is no path along the directed edges that leads back to the starting node.</FONT>
