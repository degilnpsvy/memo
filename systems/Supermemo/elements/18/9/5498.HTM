Git implements the history of commits within a repository as a DAG. In the commit graph, each node is a single commit, and all edges are directed from one descendant node to another parent node, forming an ancestor relationship. The graphs you saw in Figure 6-3 and Figure 6-4 are both DAGs. When speaking of the history of commits and discussing the relationship between commits in a graph, the individual commit nodes are often labeled as shown in Figure 6-5.

<P>In these diagrams, time is roughly left to right. A is the initial commit because it has no parent, and B occurred after A. Both E and C occurred after B, but no claim can be made about the relative timing between C and E; either could have occurred before the other. <FONT class=extract>In fact, Git doesn&#8217;t really care about the time or timing (absolute or relative) of commits. The actual &#8220;wall clock&#8221; time of a commit can be misleading because a computer&#8217;s clock can be set incorrectly or inconsistently. Within a distributed development environment, the problem is exacerbated. Time stamps can&#8217;t be trusted. What is certain, though, is that if commit Y points to parent X, then X captures the repository state prior to the repository state of commit Y, regardless of what time stamps might be on the commits.</FONT> </P>

<P>The commits E and C share a common parent, B. Thus, B is the origin of a branch. The master branch begins with commits A, B, C, and D. Meanwhile, the sequence of commits A, B, E, F, and G form the branch named pr-17. The branch pr-17 points to commit G. (You can read more about branches in Chapter 7.) </P>
<P>The commit H is a merge commit, where the pr-17 branch has been merged into the master branch. Because it&#8217;s a merge, H has more than one commit parent&#8212;in this case, D and G. After this commit is made, master will be updated to refer to the new commit H, but pr-17 will continue to refer to G. (The merge operation is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.)
