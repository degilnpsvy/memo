When your repository history is a simple linear series of commits, it&#8217;s fairly easy to understand how a range works. But when branches or merges are involved in the graph, things can become a bit tricky and so it&#8217;s important to understand the rigorous definition. Let&#8217;s look at a few more examples. In the case of a master branch with a linear history, as shown in Figure 6-10, the set B..E, the set ^B E, and the set of C, D, and E are equivalent.
