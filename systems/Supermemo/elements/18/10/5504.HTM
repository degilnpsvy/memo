Reachability in Graphs </P>
<P>In graph theory, a node X is said to be reachable from another node A if you can start at A, travel along the arcs of the graph according to the rules, and arrive at X. The set of reachable nodes for a node A is the collection of all nodes reachable from A. In a Git commit graph, the set of reachable commits are those you can reach from a given commit by traversing the directed parent links. Conceptually and in terms of dataflow, the set of reachable commits is the set of ancestor commits that flow into and contribute to a given starting commit<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt; FONT-FAMILY: Birka; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Birka; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">.</SPAN>
