Why Not Just Merge Each Change One by One? </P>
<P>You might ask wouldn&#8217;t it be possible to have it both ways: a simple, linear history with every individual commit represented? Git could just take all the commits from some_branch and apply them, one by one, onto my_branch. But that wouldn&#8217;t be the same thing at all. </P>
<P>An important observation about Git&#8217;s commit histories is that each revision in the history is real. (You can read more about treating alternate histories as equal realities in Chapter 13.)</P>
<P>If you apply a sequence of someone else&#8217;s patches on top of your version, you will create a series of entirely new versions with the union of their changes and yours. Presumably, you will test the final version as you always would. But what about all those new, intermediate versions? In reality, those versions never existed: nobody actually produced those commits, so nobody can say for sure whether they ever worked.</P>
<P>Git keeps a detailed history so that you can later revisit what your files were like at a particular moment in the past. If some of your merged commits reflect file versions that never really existed, then you&#8217;ve lost the reason for having a detailed history in the first place!</P>
<P>This is why Git merges don&#8217;t work that way. If you were ask &#8220;What was it like five minutes before I did the merge?&#8221; then the answer would be ambiguous. Instead you must ask about either my_branch or some_branch specifically, because both were different five minutes ago and Git can give the true answer for each one.</P>
<P>Even though you almost always want the standard history merging behavior, Git can also apply a sequence of patches (see Chapter 14) as described here. This process is called rebasing and is discussed in Chapter 10. The implications of changing commit histories are discussed in &#8220;Changing Public History&#8221; on page 248 of Chapter 13.<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Birka; mso-bidi-font-family: Birka; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">&nbsp;</SPAN>
