<P>Figure 9-8. Simple criss-cross merge </P>
<P>The nodes a and b are both merge bases for a merge between A and B. Either one could be used as the merge base and yield reasonable results. In this case, the recursive strategy would merge a and b into a temporary merge base, using that as the merge base for A and B.</P>
<P>Because a and b could have the same problem, merging them could require another merge of still older commits. That is why this algorithm is called recursive.</P></BODY>
