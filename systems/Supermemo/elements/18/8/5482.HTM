As Figure 5-4 shows, the commit initiates three steps. First, the virtual tree object that is the index gets converted into a real tree object and placed into the object store under its SHA1 name. Second, a new commit object is created with your log message. The new commit points to the newly created tree object and also to the previous or parent commit. Third, the master branch ref is moved from the most recent commit to the newly created commit object, becoming the new master HEAD. </P>
<P>An interesting detail is that the working directory, index, and object store (represented by the HEAD of master) are once again all synchronized and in agreement, just as they were in Figure 5-1.
