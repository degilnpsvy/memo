Branch or Tag? 
<P></P>
<P>90 A branch and a tag seem similar, perhaps even interchangeable. So when should you use a tag name and when should you use a branch name? </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A tag and a branch serve different purposes. A tag is meant to be a static name that does not change or move over time. Once applied, you should leave it alone. It serves as a stake in the ground and reference point. On the other hand, a branch is dynamic and moves with each commit you make. The branch name is designed to follow your continuing development.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Curiously, you can name a branch and a tag with the same name. If you do, you will have to use their full ref names to distinguish them. For example, you could use refs/tags/v1.0 and refs/heads/v1.0. You may want to use the same name as a branch name during development and then convert it to a tag name at the conclusion of your development. Naming branches and tags is ultimately up to you and your project policies. However, you should consider the key differentiating characteristic: is this name static and immutable, or is it dynamic for development? The former should be a tag and the latter a branch.</FONT></P>
<P>Finally, unless you have a compelling reason to do so, you should simply avoid using the same name for both a branch and a tag.
