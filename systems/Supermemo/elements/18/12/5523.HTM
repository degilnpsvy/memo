Reasons for Using Branches </P>
<P>A branch can be created for a countless number of technical, philosophical, managerial, and even social reasons. Here is just a smattering of common rationales. </P>
<P>? A branch often represents an individual customer release. If you want to start version 1.1 of your project but you know that some of your customers want to stick with version 1.0, then keep the old version alive as a separate branch. </P>
<P>? A branch can encapsulate a development phase, such as the prototype, beta, stable, or bleeding-edge release. You can think of the version 1.1 release as a separate phase, too; the maintenance release.</P>
<P>? A branch can isolate the development of a single feature or research into a particularly complex bug. For example, you can introduce a branch for a well-defined and conceptually isolated task or to facilitate a merge of several branches prior to a release.</P>
<P>It may seem like overkill to create a new branch just to fix one bug, but Git&#8217;s branching system encourages such small-scale use.</P>
<P>? An individual branch can represent the work of an individual contributor. Another branch&#8212;the &#8220;integration&#8221; branch&#8212;can be used specifically to unify efforts. Git refers to a branch like those just listed as a topic branch or a development branch. The word &#8220;topic&#8221; simply indicates that each branch in the repository has a particular purpose.</P>
<P>Git also has the notion of a tracking branch, or a branch to keep clones of a repository in sync. Chapter 12 explains how to use a tracking branch.
