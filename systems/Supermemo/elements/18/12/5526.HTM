Dos and Don&#8217;ts in Branch Names 
<P></P>
<P>Branch names must conform to a few simple rules. </P>
<P>? You can use the forward slash (/) to create a hierarchical name scheme. However, the name cannot end with a slash. </P>
<P>? The name cannot start with a minus sign (-). </P>
<P>? No slash-separated component can begin with a dot (.). A branch name such as feature/.new is invalid. </P>
<P>? The name cannot contain two consecutive dots (..) anywhere. </P>
<P>?&nbsp;Further, the name cannot contain:</P>
<P>&#8212; Any space or other whitespace character </P>
<P>&#8212; A character that has special meaning to Git, including the tilde (~), caret (^), colon (:), question mark (?), asterisk (*), and open bracket ([) </P>
<P>&#8212; An ASCII control character, which is any byte with a value lower than \040 octal, or the DEL character (\177 octal)</P>
<P>These branch name rules are enforced by the git check-ref-format plumbing command, and they are designed to ensure that each branch name is both easily typed and usable as a filename within the .git directory and scripts.
