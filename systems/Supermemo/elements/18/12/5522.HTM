CHAPTER 7 Branches </P>
<P>A branch is the fundamental means of launching a separate line of development within a software project. A branch is a split from a kind of unified, primal state, allowing development to continue in multiple directions simultaneously and, potentially, to produce different versions of the project. Often, a branch is reconciled and merged with other branches to reunite disparate efforts. </P>
<P>Git allows many branches and thus many different lines of development within a repository. Git&#8217;s branching system is lightweight and simple. Moreover, Git has first rate support for merges. As a result, most Git users make routine use of branches. This chapter shows you how to select, create, view, and remove branches. It also provides some best practices, so your branches don&#8217;t twist into something akin to a manzanita.( 1. OK, OK. It&#8217;s a small, bushy tree, a highly branched shrub thing. Perhaps a better analogy is a banyan tree. )
