Listing Branch Names 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The git branch command lists branch names found in the repository. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ git branch </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>bug/pr-1 </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>dev</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>* master</FONT></P>
<P>In this example, three topic branches are shown. The branch currently checked out into your working tree is identified by the asterisk. This example also shows two other branches, bug/pr-1 and dev.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Without additional parameters, only topic branches in the repository are listed. As you&#8217;ll see in Chapter 12, there may be additional remote tracking branches in your repository. You can list those with the -r option. You can list both topic and remote branches with -a.</FONT>
