Globally Unique Identifiers </P>
<P>An important characteristic of the SHA1 hash computation is that it always computes the same ID for identical content, regardless of where that content is. In other words, the same file content in different directories and even on different machines yields the exact same SHA1 hash ID. Thus, the SHA1 hash ID of a file is an effective globally unique identifier. </P>
<P>A powerful corollary is that files or blobs of arbitrary size can be compared for equality across the Internet by merely comparing their SHA1 identifiers.
