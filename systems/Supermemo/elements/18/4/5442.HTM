Basic Concepts </P>
<P>The previous chapter presented a typical application of Git&#8212;and probably sparked a good number of questions. Does Git store the entire file at every commit? What&#8217;s the purpose of the .git directory? Why does a commit ID resemble gibberish? Should I take note of it? </P>
<P>If you&#8217;ve used another VCS, such as SVN or CVS, the commands in the last chapter likely seemed familiar. Indeed, Git serves the same function and provides all the operations you expect from a modern VCS. However, Git differs in some fundamental and surprising ways.</P>
<P>In this chapter, we explore why and how Git differs by examining the key components of its architecture and some important concepts. Here we focus on the basics and demonstrate how to interact with one repository; Chapter 12 explains how to work with many, interconnected repositories. Keeping track of multiple repositories may seem like a daunting prospect, but the fundamentals you learn in this chapter apply just the same.
