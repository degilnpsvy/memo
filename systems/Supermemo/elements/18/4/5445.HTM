Index 
<P></P>
<P>The index is a temporary and dynamic binary file that describes the directory structure of the entire repository. More specifically, the index captures a version of the project&#8217;s overall structure at some moment in time. The project&#8217;s state could be represented by a commit and a tree from any point in the project&#8217;s history, or it could be a future state toward which you are actively developing. </P>
<P>One of the key, distinguishing features of Git is that it enables you to alter the contents of the index in methodical, well-defined steps. The index allows a separation between incremental development steps and the committal of those changes. </P>
<P>Here&#8217;s how it works. As the developer, you execute Git commands to stage changes in the index. Changes usually add, delete, or edit some file or set of files. The index records and retains those changes, keeping them safe until you are ready to commit them. You can also remove or replace changes in the index. Thus, the index allows a gradual transition, usually guided by you, from one complex repository state to another, presumably better state.</P>
<P>As you&#8217;ll see in Chapter 9, the index plays an important role in merges, allowing multiple versions of the same file to be managed, inspected, and manipulated simultaneously.
