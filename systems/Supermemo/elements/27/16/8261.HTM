Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists. 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Unordered list items start with &#8216;-&#8217;, &#8216;+&#8217;, or &#8216;*&#8217; as bullets.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Ordered list items start with a numeral followed by either a period or a right parenthesis15, such as &#8216;1.&#8217; or &#8216;1)&#8217;16. If you want a list to start with a different value (e.g., 20), start the text of the item with [@20]17. Those constructs can be used in any item of the list in order to enforce a particular numbering. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Description list items are unordered list items, and contain the separator &#8216; :: &#8217; to distinguish the description term from the description.~</FONT>
