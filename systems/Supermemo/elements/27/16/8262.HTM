Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the first line. In particular, if an ordered list reaches number &#8216;10.&#8217;, then the 2&#8211;digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the other numbers in the list. An item ends before the next line that is less or equally indented than its bullet/number.
