Once you have identified the commit from which a branch should start, simply use the git branch command. Thus, to create a new branch off the HEAD of your current branch for the purposes of fixing Problem Report #1138, you might use: 
<P></P>
<P>$ git branch prs/pr-1138</P>
<P>The basic form of the command is </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> </P>
<P>When no starting-commit is specified, the default is the revision committed most recently on the current branch. In other words, the default is to start a new branch at the point where you&#8217;re working right now.
