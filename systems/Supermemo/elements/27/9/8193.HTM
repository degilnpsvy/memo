<P class=docText>As we mentioned, you can type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>u</SPAN> at any time to remove the deletion flags from the files. Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>u</SPAN> moves you to the next file in the list, and, if it is marked, unmarks it. You can also use <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> to unmark. This command undeletes the <SPAN class=docEmphasis>previous</SPAN> file in the list and then moves up one line.
