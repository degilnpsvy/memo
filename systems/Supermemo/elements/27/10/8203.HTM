<P class=docText>This is the usual way of deleting files, but if you want a file deleted right away, type an uppercase <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. Emacs asks if you want to delete the file <SPAN class=docEmphBold>(yes or no)</SPAN>. Type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>yes</SPAN> to delete the file immediately or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>no</SPAN> to change your mind. In Dired, this is one of a number of cases in which the lowercase letter (like <SPAN class=docEmphBold>d</SPAN> to flag for deletion) and the uppercase letter (like <SPAN class=docEmphBold>D</SPAN> to delete immediately) have a different meaning.
