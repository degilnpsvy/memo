<P>Artistic style is a console program that receives information from the command line. The format of the command line is:</P><PRE>astyle&nbsp; [options]&nbsp; <EM>SourceFile1&nbsp; SourceFile2&nbsp; SourceFile3</EM>&nbsp; [ . . . ]
</PRE>
<P>The block parens [ ] indicate that more than one option or more than one filename can be entered. They are NOT actually included in the command. For the options format see the following Options section.</P>
<DIV class=code>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example to format a single file:</P><PRE>astyle  --style=allman  /home/user/project/foo.cpp
</PRE>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Example to format all .cpp and .h files recursively:</P><PRE>astyle  --style=allman --recursive  /home/user/project/*.cpp  /home/user/project/*.h
</PRE></DIV>
<P>Another option will format a single file and change the name:</P><PRE>astyle [options] &lt; <EM>OriginalSourceFile</EM> &gt; <EM>BeautifiedSourceFile</EM>
</PRE>
<P>The <SPAN style="COLOR: #0000a0">&lt;</SPAN> and <SPAN style="COLOR: #0000a0">&gt;</SPAN> characters are used to redirect the files into standard input (cin) and out of standard output (cout) - don't forget them! With this option only one file at a time can be formatted. Wildcards are not recognized, there are no console messages, and a backup is not created. On Windows the output will always have Windows line ends.</P>
