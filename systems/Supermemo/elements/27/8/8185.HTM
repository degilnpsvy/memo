If you want to edit a file from the Dired buffer, move to the line the file is on and press <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>Enter</FONT></SPAN> (a variety of other keystrokes work as well, such as <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>f</FONT></SPAN> for find or <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> for edit).
