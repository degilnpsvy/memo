If you learned how to delete buffers, you know the basics of deleting files with Dired. First, you flag a file for deletion by moving to the file's name and typing <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. Doing this places a <SPAN class=docEmphBold>D</SPAN> on the left margin and moves the cursor to the next file in the list. You can flag as many files as you want. You can change your mind at this point and type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>u</SPAN> to undelete the file. At some later time, you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>x</SPAN> to delete the files (more on this in a minute).
