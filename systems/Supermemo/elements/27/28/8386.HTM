Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string &#8216;=&gt;&#8217;. Note that the full text is still in the buffer but is hidden. To see the full text, hold the mouse over the field&#8212;a tool-tip window will show the full content. To edit such a field, use the command <FONT class=clozed>C-c ` (that is C-c followed by the backquote)</FONT> . This will open a new window with the full field. Edit it and finish with C-c C-c.
