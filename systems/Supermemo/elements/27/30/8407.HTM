<FONT class=clozed>the pipeline design rules out the implementation of instructions that do any operation on memory variables. Data from cache or memory is obtained only in phase 4, which is much too late to be available to the ALU. </FONT>Memory accesses occur only as simple load or store instructions that move the data to or from registers (you will see this described as a load/store architecture).
