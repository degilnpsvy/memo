<P class=docText>By default, the list <A name=gnu3-CHP-5-ITERM-2159></A>is sorted by filename, but you can sort it by date instead. Look at the mode line. It says <SPAN class=docEmphBold>(</SPAN><TT>Dired by name</TT><SPAN class=docEmphBold>)</SPAN>. To change the order of the display, type <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. This command puts the newest files at the top of the list, solving the "Where's that file I worked on yesterday?" problem quite easily. The mode line says <SPAN class=docEmphBold>(</SPAN><TT>Dired by date</TT><SPAN class=docEmphBold>)</SPAN>. Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SPAN> again toggles the sort, putting it back in alphabetical order.
