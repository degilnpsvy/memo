Every section has a virtual address (VMA) and a load address (LMA); see &#8220;Basic Linker Script Concepts&#8221; on page 30. The address expression that, may appear in an output section description sets the VMA. <FONT class=extract>The linker will normally set the LMA equal to the VMA. You can change that by using the AT keyword. The expression, LMA, that follows the AT keyword specifies the load address of the section. This feature is designed to make it easy to build a ROM image.</FONT>
