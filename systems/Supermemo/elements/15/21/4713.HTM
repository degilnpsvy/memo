&#8220;Consistent&#8221; memory: </P>
<P>Linux guarantees that &#8220;consistent&#8221; memory is I/O coherent, possibly at some cost to performance. On a MIPS CPU this is likely to be uncached, and the cost to performance is considerable. But consistent buffers are the best way to handle small memory-resident control structures for complex device controllers.
