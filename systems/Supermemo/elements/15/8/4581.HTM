It&#8217;s strongly recommended that you use MIPS conventional register names as summarized in Table 2.1; to do this, you should pass your source through the C preprocessor and #include a file probably called mips/regdef.h. If you choose not to use the preprocessor, remember that the assembler expects <FONT class=clozed>general-purpose register names to be written in the form &#8220;dollar-number,&#8221; such as $3 to specify GP register 3, and that the GP register numbers run from 0 through 31.</FONT>
