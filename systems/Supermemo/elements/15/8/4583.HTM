Linux has a <FONT class=clozed>DMA API </FONT>that exports routines to device drivers that manage DMA data flow (many of the routines become null in an I/O coherent system). You can read about it in the documentation provided with the Linux kernel sources, which includes Documentation/DMA-API.txt. In fact, if you&#8217;re writing or porting a device driver, you should read that.
