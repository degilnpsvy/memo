There is no direct analog of C&#8217;s &#8220;pointer&#8221; operator. But when the assembler is expecting a pointer-size value a label (or any other relocatable symbol) is replaced with its address. The identifier &#8220;.&#8221; (dot) represents the address of the current instruction or data declaration. You can even do some limited arithmetic with these things.
