<FONT class=clozed>n32: A partner ABI to n64, this is really for &#8220;32-bit&#8221; programs on 64-bit CPUs. It is mostly the same as n64, except for having pointers and the C long data type implemented as 32 bits. That can be useful&#8212;for applications where a 32-bit memory space is already spacious, 64-bit pointers represent nothing but extra overhead.</FONT>
