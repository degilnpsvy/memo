The most important ABIs in MIPS history are:

<P><FONT class=clozed>o32: Grew from traditional MIPS conventions (&#8220;o&#8221; for old), and described in detail here. o32 is still pretty much universally used by embedded toolchains and for 32-bit Linux. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>n64: New formal ABI for 64-bit programs on 64-bit CPUs running under Silicon Graphics&#8217; Irix operating system. SGI&#8217;s 64-bit model makes both pointers and C long integer types into 64-bit data items. However, n64 also changes the conventions for using registers and the rules for passing parameters; because it puts more arguments in registers, it improves performance slightly. </FONT></P>
