The most important ABIs in MIPS history are:

<P><SPAN class=cloze></SPAN><FONT class=clozed>n64: New formal ABI for 64-bit programs on 64-bit CPUs running under Silicon Graphics&#8217; Irix operating system. SGI&#8217;s 64-bit model makes both pointers and C long integer types into 64-bit data items. However, n64 also changes the conventions for using registers and the rules for passing parameters; because it puts more arguments in registers, it improves performance slightly. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>n32: A partner ABI to n64, this is really for &#8220;32-bit&#8221; programs on 64-bit CPUs. It is mostly the same as n64, except for having pointers and the C long data type implemented as 32 bits. That can be useful&#8212;for applications where a 32-bit memory space is already spacious, 64-bit pointers represent nothing but extra overhead.</FONT>
