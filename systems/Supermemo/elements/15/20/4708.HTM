Each section in an object file has a name and a size. Most sections also have an associated block of data, known as the section contents. <FONT class=extract>A section may be marked as loadable, meaning that the contents should be loaded into memory when the output file is run.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>A section with no contents may be allocatable, which means that an area in memory should be set aside, but nothing in particular should be loaded there (in some cases this memory must be zeroed out).</FONT> <FONT class=extract>A section, which is neither loadable nor allocatable, typically contains some sort of debugging information.</SPAN></FONT>
