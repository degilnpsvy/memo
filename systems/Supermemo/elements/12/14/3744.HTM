12.1.11 Imprecise Debug Breaks </P>
<P>Instruction breakpoints, and data breakpoints filtering only on address conditions, break with DEPC pointing to the matching instruction. More accurately, such exceptions are &#8220;precise exceptions,&#8221; in the sense discussed in section 5.1. Most exceptions in MIPS architecture CPUs are precise. But many MIPS CPUs optimize loads and stores by permitting the CPU to run on at least until it needs to use the data from a load, so data breakpoints that filter on the data value are imprecise. The debug exception will happen to whichever instruction (typically later in the instruction stream) is running when the hardware detects the match. The debugging software must cope as best it can<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Minion-Regular-0-1000-19; mso-bidi-font-family: Minion-Regular-0-1000-19; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">.</SPAN>
