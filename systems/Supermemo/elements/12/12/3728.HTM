An ICE was a plug-in replacement for your CPU with a large and proprietary cable leading to a rack full of electronics. The ICE executed instructions just like a CPU, but could be stopped and interrogated.</SPAN></P>

ICE boxes started off expensive and got ever more so: Once they cost tens of thousands of dollars, lots of teams found ways of debugging systems without them. As the 1980s progressed, that undermined the market for ICE boxes.</SPAN></P>

With an on-chip debug unit, the critical paths (which might have made the CPU slower) were local, so the system could run at full speed. The probe you needed to make the connection and the complex host software that ran itwere the sort of things they knew how to make. That was good, but they ran into a problem: They either had to sell the tiny probe and software for $10,000, or change their business model to sell more units at lower prices. Technological change is easy, but institutional change is not; for the most part, the ICE manufacturers tried to keep their prices up and were bypassed.</SPAN></P>

With the help of some ICE manufacturers, they developed the EJTAG specification much as it is now. But these days probes cost less than $1,000 and attach to the software debugger of your choice.</SPAN>
