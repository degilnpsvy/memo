Conditional branches have only a <FONT class=clozed>16-bit displacement field</FONT>&#8212;giving <FONT class=clozed>a 2^18-byte </FONT>range, since instructions <FONT class=clozed>are four-byte aligned</FONT>&#8212;which is interpreted as a <FONT class=clozed>signed PC-relative displacement</FONT>. Compilers can only code a simple conditional branch instruction if they know that the target will be within <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>of the instruction following the branch.
