Conditional branches have only a <FONT class=clozed>16-bit displacement field</FONT>&#8212;giving <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>range, since instructions are four-byte aligned&#8212;which is interpreted as a signed PC-relative displacement. Compilers can only code a simple conditional branch instruction if they know that the target will be within 128 KB of the instruction following the branch.
