Like all the modern computers I know of, MIPS uses twos-complement representation for signed integers&#8212;so in any data size &#8220;-1&#8221; is represented by binary all-ones. The overwhelming advantage of twos-complement numbers is that the basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) have the same implementation for signed and unsigned data types.( 2. At least, until the result has greater precision than the operands.)
