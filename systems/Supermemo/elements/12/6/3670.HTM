To work together with each other and with the operating system, the compiled code of a module relies on conventions (enforced by compilers, and therefore mandatory for assembly language programmers) about register usage, stack construction, argument passing, and so on.</SPAN></P>

Overall conventions about register use were introduced in section 2.2.1, and a description of how the compiler packages up data for a MIPS CPU was in section 11.1.</SPAN>
