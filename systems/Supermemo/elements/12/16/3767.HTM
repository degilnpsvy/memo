Integer multiply operations produce a result with twice the precision of the operands, and that means that they need to produce genuinely different results for signed and unsigned inputs; hence, there are two instructions: mult and multu. Note that the low part of the result, left in the lo register, will be the same for both the signed and the unsigned version; it&#8217;s the way that overflows into hi are handled that differs.
