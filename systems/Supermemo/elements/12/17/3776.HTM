No byte or halfword arithmetic: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>All arithmetical and logical operations are performed on 32-bit quantities.</FONT> Byte and/or halfword arithmetic requires significant extra resources and many more opcodes, and it is rarely really useful. The C language&#8217;s semantics cause most calculations to be carried out with int precision, and for MIPS int is a 32-bit integer. However, where a program explicitly does arithmetic as short or char, a MIPS compiler must insert extra code to make sure that the results wrap and overflow as they would on a native 16- or 8-bit machine.
