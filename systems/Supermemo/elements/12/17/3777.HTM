No special stack support:

<P><FONT class=extract>Conventional MIPS assembly usage does define one of the registers as a stack pointer, but there&#8217;s nothing special to the hardware about sp. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>There is a recommended format for the stack frame layout of subroutines, so that you can mix modules from different languages and compilers; you should almost certainly stick to these conventions, but they have no relationship to the hardware. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A stack pop wouldn&#8217;t fit the pipeline, because it would have two register values to write (the data from the stack and the incremented pointer value).</FONT>
