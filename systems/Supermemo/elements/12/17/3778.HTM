Minimal subroutine support: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed><FONT class=extract>There is one special feature: jump instructions have a jump and link option, which stores the return address into a register. $31 is the default, so for convenience and by convention $31 becomes the return address register.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>This is less sophisticated than storing the return address on a stack, but it has some significant advantages. Two examples will give you a feeling for the argument: First, it preserves a pure separation between branch and memory-accessing instructions; second, it can aid efficiency when calling small subroutines that don&#8217;t need to save the return address on the stack at all.</FONT></FONT>
