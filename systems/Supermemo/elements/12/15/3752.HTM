The relationship between a repository that contains a remote reference (the referrer) and that remote repository (the referee) is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. A remote always points in one direction from referrer to referee. The referee has no idea that some other repository points to it. Another way to say this is as follows: a clone knows where its upstream repository is, but the upstream repository doesn&#8217;t know where its clones are.
