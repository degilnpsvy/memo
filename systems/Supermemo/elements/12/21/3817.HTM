Move from hi and so on. These are instructions for accessing the integer multiply/divide unit result registers hi and lo.</P>
<P>You won&#8217;t write the mflo/ mfhi instructions in regular code if you stick to the synthetic mul and div instructions, which retrieve result data for themselves. </P>
<P>MIPS integer multiply, mult or multu, always produces a result with twice the bit length of the general-purpose registers, eliminating the possibility of overflow. The high-order and low-order register-sized pieces of the result are returned in hi and lo, respectively. </P>
