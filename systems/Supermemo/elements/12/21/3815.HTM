There are limitations. There is no guarantee about the relative timing of load/stores and the execution of the sync itself; it merely separates load/stores before the instruction from those after. sync is not guaranteed to help out with the problem of ensuring some timing relationship between the CPU&#8217;s program execution and external writes, which we mention in section 10.4. </P>
<P>And inside a system sync works only on certain access types (uncached and coherent cached accesses).Much &#8220;normal&#8221; cached memory is noncoherent; any data space that is known not to be shared is safe, and so is anything that is read-only to the sharing tasks<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Minion-Regular-0-1000-18; mso-bidi-font-family: Minion-Regular-0-1000-18; mso-font-kerning: 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US>.</SPAN></SPAN>
