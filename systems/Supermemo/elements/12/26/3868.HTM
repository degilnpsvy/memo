This problem afflicts caches where the address used to generate the cache index is different from the address stored in the cache tag. It&#8217;s common practice for the L1 caches of MIPS CPUs to be indexed using the virtual address and tagged using the physical address. This is good for performance: If we used a physical index, we couldn&#8217;t even start a cache lookup until the address had been translated through the TLB. But it can lead to aliases. (See Figure 4.3.)
