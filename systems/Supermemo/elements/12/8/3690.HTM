When you define data in C, the data you get in memory is compilation-target dependent.( 1. Strictly speaking, it&#8217;s also compiler dependent, but in practice MIPS compilers all comply with the conventions described in this section.) Moreover, while it&#8217;s &#8220;nonportable&#8221; to assume you have a particular layout, nonportable C is often a more maintainable way of defining a fixed data layout than anything else at your disposal.
