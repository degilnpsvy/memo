We could simply decide that the high bits should be undefined; when you&#8217;re being MIPS32 compatible, the high bits of registers can contain any old garbage. This is easy to achieve but fails the third test above: We would need separate MIPS32 and MIPS64 versions of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>
