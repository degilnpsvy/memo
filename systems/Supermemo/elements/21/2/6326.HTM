A MIPS CPU without a cache isn&#8217;t really a RISC. Perhaps that&#8217;s not fair; for special purposes you might be able to build a MIPS CPU with a small, tightly coupled memory that can be accessed in a fixed number of pipeline stages (preferably one). But <FONT class=extract>MIPS CPUs have always had cache hardware built tightly into the pipeline.</FONT>
