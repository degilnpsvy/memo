Configuring an Alias 
<P></P>
<P>For starters, here is a tip for setting up command aliases. If there is a common but complex Git command that you type frequently, consider setting up a simple Git alias for it. </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> 
<P><SPAN class=cloze></SPAN>In this example, I&#8217;ve made up the show-graph alias and made it available for use in any repository I make. Now when I use the command git show-graph, it is just like I had typed that long git log command with all those options.
