<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Traditionally, on UNIX systems, a privileged process is one whose effective user ID is 0 (superuser). Such a process bypasses the permission restrictions normally applied by the kernel. By contrast, the term unprivileged(or nonprivileged) is applied to processes run by other users. Such processes have a nonzero effective user ID and must abide by the permission rules enforced by the kernel.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A process may be privileged because it was created by another privileged process&#8212;for example, by a login shell started by root(superuser). Another way a process may become privileged is via the set-user-ID mechanism, which allows a process to assume an effective user ID that is the same as the user ID of the program file that it is executing.</SPAN>
