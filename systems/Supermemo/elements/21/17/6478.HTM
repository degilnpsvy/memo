<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">An object library is a file containing the compiled object code for a (usually logically related) set of functions that may be called from application programs. Placing code for a set of functions in a single object library eases the tasks of program creation and maintenance. Modern UNIX systems provide two types of object libraries: static libraries and shared libraries.</SPAN>
