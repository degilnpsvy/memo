<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">When booting the system, the kernel creates a special process called init, the &#8220;parent of all processes,&#8221; which is derived from the program file /sbin/init. All processes on the system are created (using fork()) either by init or by one of its descendants. The init process always has the process ID 1 and runs with superuser privileges. The init process can&#8217;t be killed (not even by the superuser), and it terminates only when the system is shut down. The main task of init is to create and monitor a range of processes required by a running system. (For details, see the init(8)manual page.)</SPAN>
