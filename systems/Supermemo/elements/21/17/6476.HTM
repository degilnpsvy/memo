<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Each process consumes resources, such as open files, memory, and CPU time. Using the setrlimit()system call, a process can establish upper limits on its consumption of various resources. Each such resource limit has two associated values: a soft limit, which limits the amount of the resource that the process may consume; and a hard limit, which is a ceiling on the value to which the soft limit may be adjusted. An unprivileged process may change its soft limit for a particular resource to any value in the range from zero up to the corresponding hard limit, but can only lower its hard limit.</SPAN></P>

<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The resource limits of the shell can be adjusted using the ulimit command (limitin the C shell). These limit settings are inherited by the child processes that the shell creates to execute commands.</SPAN>
