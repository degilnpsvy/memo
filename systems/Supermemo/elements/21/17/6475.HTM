<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Each process has an environment list, which is a set of environment variables that are maintained within the user-space memory of the process. Each element of this list consists of a name and an associated value. When a new process is created via fork(), it inherits a copy of its parent&#8217;s environment. Thus, the environment provides a mechanism for a parent process to communicate information to a child process. When a process replaces the program that it is running using exec(), the new program either inherits the environment used by the old program or receives a</SPAN></P>

<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">C programs can access the environment using an external variable (char **environ), and various library functions allow a process to retrieve and modify values in its environment.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Environment variables are used for a variety of purposes. For example, the shell defines and uses a range of variables that can be accessed by scripts and programs executed from the shell. These include the variable HOME, which specifies the pathname of the user&#8217;s login directory, and the variable PATH, which specifies a list of directories that the shell should search when looking for programs corresponding to commands entered by the user.</SPAN>
