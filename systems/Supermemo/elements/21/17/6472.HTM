<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Since kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally accorded to the superuser into a set of distinct units called capabilities. Each privileged operation is associated with a particular capability, and a process can perform an operation only if it has the corresponding capability. A traditional superuser process (effective user ID of 0) corresponds to a process with all capabilities enabled.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Granting a subset of capabilities to a process allows it to perform some of the operations normally permitted to the superuser, while preventing it from performing others.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Capabilities are described in detail in Chapter 39. In the remainder of the book, when noting that a particular operation can be performed only by a privileged process, we&#8217;ll usually identify the specific capability in parentheses. Capability names begin with the prefix CAP_, as in CAP_KILL.</SPAN>
