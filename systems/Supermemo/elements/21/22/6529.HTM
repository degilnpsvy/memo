Commit objects are also stored in a graph structure, although it&#8217;s completely different from the structures used by tree objects. When you make a new commit, you can give it one or more parent commits. By following back through the chain of parents, you can discover the history of your project. More details about commits and the commit graph are given in Chapter 6.
