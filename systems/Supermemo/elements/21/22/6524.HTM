But what does a tree look like? Because it&#8217;s an object, just like the blob, you can use the same low-level command to view it.

<P>$ <FONT class=clozed>git cat-file -p</FONT> 68aba6 </P>
<P>100644 blob 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad hello.txt </P>
<P>The contents of the object should be easy to interpret. The first number, 100644, represents the file attributes of the object in octal, which should be familiar to anyone who has used the Unix chmod command. Here, 3b18e5 is the object name of the hello world blob, and hello.txt is the name associated with that blob.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>It is now easy to see that the tree object has captured the information that was in the index when you ran git ls-files -s.</FONT>
