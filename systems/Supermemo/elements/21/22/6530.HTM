Finally, the last object Git manages is the tag. <FONT class=extract>Although Git implements only one kind of tag object, there are two basic tag types, usually called lightweight and annotated.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Lightweight tags are simply references to a commit object and are usually considered private to a repository. These tags do not create a permanent object in the object store.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>An annotated tag is more substantial and creates an object. It contains a message, supplied by you, and can be digitally signed using a GnuPG key according to RFC4880.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Git treats both lightweight and annotated tag names equivalently for the purposes of naming a commit.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>However, by default, many Git commands work only on annotated tags, because they are considered &#8220;permanent&#8221; objects.</FONT>
