<FONT class=extract>In real life, you can (and should!) pass over the low-level git write-tree and git commit-tree steps, and just use the git commit command.</FONT> You don&#8217;t need to remember all those <FONT class=extract>plumbing commands</FONT> to be a perfectly happy Git user. A basic commit object is fairly simple, and it&#8217;s the last ingredient required for a real RCS. The commit object just shown is the simplest possible one, containing: 
<P></P>
<P>? The name of a tree object that actually identifies the associated files </P>
<P>? The name of the person who composed the new version (the author) and the time when it was composed </P>
<P>? The name of the person who placed the new version into the repository (the committer) and the time when it was committed </P>
<P>? A description of the reason for this revision (the commit message)
