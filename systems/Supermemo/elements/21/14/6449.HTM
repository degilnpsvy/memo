<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">One user, known as the superuser, has special privileges within the system. The superuser account has user ID 0, and normally has the login name root. On typical UNIX systems, the superuser bypasses all permission checks in the system. Thus, for example, the superuser can access any file in the system, regardless of the permissions on that file, and can send signals to any user process in the system. The system administrator uses the superuser account to perform various administrative tasks on the system.</SPAN>
