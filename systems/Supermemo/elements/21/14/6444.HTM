<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Modern texts covering operating systems concepts and design, with particular reference to UNIX systems, include [Tanenbaum, 2007], [Tanenbaum &amp; Woodhull, 2006], and [Vahalia, 1996], the last of these containing much detail on virtual memory architectures. [Goodheart &amp; Cox, 1994] provide details on System V Release 4. [Maxwell, 1999] provides an annotated listing of selected parts of the Linux 2.2.5 kernel. [Lions, 1996] is a detailed exposition of the Sixth Edition UNIX source code that remains a useful introductionto UNIX operating system internals. [Bovet &amp; Cesati, 2005] describes the implementation of the Linux 2.6 kernel.</SPAN>
