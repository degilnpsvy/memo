<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Modern processor architectures typically allow the CPU to operate in at least two different modes: user mode and kernel mode(sometimes also referred to as supervisor mode). Hardware instructions allow switching from one mode to the other. Correspondingly, areas of virtual memory can be marked as being part of user space or kernel space. When running in user mode, the CPU can access only memory that is marked as being in user space; attempts to access memory in kernel space result in a hardware exception. When running in kernel mode, the CPU can access both user and kernel memory space.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Certain operations can be performed only while the processor is operating in kernel mode. Examples include executing the halt instruction to stop the system, accessing the memory-management hardware, and initiating device I/O operations. By taking advantage of this hardware design to place the operating system in kernel space, operating system implementers can ensure that user processes are not able to access the instructions and data structures of the kernel, or to perform operations that would adversely affect the operation of the system.</SPAN>
