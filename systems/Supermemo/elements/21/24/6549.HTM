Removing a file from your directory and the index does not remove the file&#8217;s existing history from the repository. Any versions of the file that are part of its history already committed in the repository remain in the object store and retain that history. Continuing the example, let&#8217;s introduce an &#8220;accidental&#8221; additional file that shouldn&#8217;t be staged and see how to remove it.</P>
<P>$ echo "Random stuff" &gt; oops </P>
<P># Can't "git rm" files Git considers "other" </P>
<P># This should be just "rm oops"</P>
<P>$ git rm oops </P>
<P>fatal: pathspec 'oops' did not match any files </P>
<P>Because git rm is also an operation on the index, the command won&#8217;t work on a file that hasn&#8217;t been previously added to the repository or index; Git must first be aware of a file.
