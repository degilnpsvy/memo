In terms of Git&#8217;s object model, the entirety of each file at the moment you issued git add was copied into the object store and indexed by its resulting SHA1 name. Staging a file is also called caching a file(2. You did see the --cached in the git status output, didn&#8217;t you? ) or &#8220;putting a file in the index.&#8221;
