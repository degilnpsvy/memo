<FONT class=extract>Git classifies your files into three groups: tracked, ignored, and untracked. </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Tracked</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&nbsp;A tracked file is any file already in the repository or any file that is staged in the index. To add a new file somefile to this group, run git add somefile.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Ignored </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>An ignored file must be explicitly declared invisible or ignored in the repository even though it may be present within your working directory. A software project tends to have a good number of ignored files. Common ignored files include temporary and scratch files, personal notes, compiler output, and most files generated automatically during a build. Git maintains a default list of files to ignore, and you can configure your repository to recognize others. Ignored files are discussed in detail later in this chapter (see &#8220;The .gitignore File&#8221; on page 58).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Untracked </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>An untracked file is any file not found in either of the previous two categories. Git considers the entire set of files in your working directory and subtracts both the tracked files and the ignored files to yield what is untracked.</FONT>
