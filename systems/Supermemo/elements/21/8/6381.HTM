It follows that it is impossible to incorporate a 32-bit constant into a single instruction (there would be no instruction bits left to encode the operation and the target register). The MIPS architects decided to make space for a 26-bit constant to encode the target address of a jump or jump to subroutine; but that&#8217;s only for a couple of instructions. Other instructions find room only for a 16-bit constant. It follows that loading an arbitrary 32-bit value requires a two-instruction sequence, and conditional branches are limited to a range of 64-K instructions.
