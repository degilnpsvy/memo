<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Each program executed by the shell is started in a new process. For example, the shell creates three processes to execute the following pipeline of commands (which displays a list of files in the current working directory sorted by file size):</SPAN></P>

<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">All major shells, except the Bourne shell, provide an interactive feature called job control, which allows the user to simultaneously execute and manipulate multiple commands or pipelines. In job-control shells, all of the processes in a pipeline are placed in a new process group or job. (In the simple case of a shell command line containing a single command, a new process group containing just a single process is created.) Each process in a process group has the same integer process group identifier, which is the same as the process ID of one of the processes in the group, termed the process group leader.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The kernel allows for various actions, notably the delivery of signals, to be performed on all members of a process group. Job-control shells use this feature to allow the user to suspend or resume all of the processes in a pipeline, as described in the next section.</SPAN>
