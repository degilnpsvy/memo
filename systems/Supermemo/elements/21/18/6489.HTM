<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Realtime applications are those that need to respond in a timely fashion to input. Frequently, such input comes from an external sensor or a specialized input device, and output takes the form of controlling some external hardware. Examples of applications with realtime response requirements include automated assembly lines, bank ATMs, and aircraft navigation systems.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Although many realtime applications require rapid responses to input, the defining factor is that the response is guaranteed to be delivered within a certain deadline time after the triggering event.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The provision of realtime responsiveness, especially where short response times are demanded, requires support from the underlying operating system. Most operating systems don&#8217;t natively provide such support because the requirements of realtime responsiveness can conflict with the requirements of multiuser timesharing operating systems. Traditional UNIX implementations are not realtime operating systems, although realtime variants have been devised. Realtime variants of Linux have also been created, and recent Linux kernels are moving toward full native support for realtime applications.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">POSIX.1b defined a number of extensions to POSIX.1 for the support of realtime applications. These include asynchronous I/O, shared memory, memory mapped files, memory locking, realtime clocks and timers, alternative scheduling policies, realtime signals, message queues, and semaphores. Even though they don&#8217;t strictly qualify as realtime, most UNIX implementations now support some or all of these extensions. (During the course of this book, we describe those features of POSIX.1b that are supported by Linux.)</SPAN></P>
