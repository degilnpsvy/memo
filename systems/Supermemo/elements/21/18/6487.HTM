On UNIX systems, calendar time is measured in seconds since midnight on the morning of January 1, 1970, Universal Coordinated Time (usually abbreviated UTC), and coordinated on the base point for time zones defined by the longitudinal line passing through Greenwich, England. This date, which is close to the birth of the UNIX system, is referred to as the Epoch.</SPAN></P>
