<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A session is a collection of process groups ( jobs). All of the processes in a session have the same session identifier. A session leader is the process that created the session, and its process ID becomes the session ID.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Sessions are used mainly by job-control shells. All of the process groups created by a job-control shell belong to the same session as the shell, which is the session leader.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Sessions usually have an associated controlling terminal. The controlling terminal is established when the session leader process first opens a terminal device. For a session created by an interactive shell, this is the terminal at which the user logged in. A terminal may be the controlling terminal of at most one session.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As a consequence of opening the controlling terminal, the session leader becomes the controlling process for the terminal. The controlling process receives a SIGHUP signal if a terminal disconnect occurs (e.g., if the terminal window is closed).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">At any point in time, one process group in a session is the foreground process group(foreground job), which may read input from the terminal and send output to it. If the user types the interrupt character (usually Control-C) or the suspend character (usually Control-Z) on the controlling terminal, then the terminal driver sends a signal that kills or suspends (i.e., stops) the foreground process group. A session can have any number of background process groups(background jobs), which are created by terminating a command with the ampersand (&amp;) character. </SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Job-control shells provide commands for listing all jobs, sending signals to jobs, and moving jobs between the foreground and background.</SPAN>
