<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Like several other UNIX implementations, Linux provides a /proc file system, which consists of a set of directories and files mounted under the /proc directory.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The /proc file system is a virtual file system that provides an interface to kernel data structures in a form that looks like files and directories on a file system. This provides an easy mechanism for viewing and changing various system attributes. In addition, a set of directories with names of the form /proc/PID, where PID is a process ID, allows us to view information about each process running on the system.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The contents of /proc files are generally in human-readable text form and can be parsed by shell scripts. A program can simply open and read from, or write to, the desired file. In most cases, a process must be privileged to modify the contents of files in the /proc directory.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As we describe various parts of the Linux programming interface, we&#8217;ll also describe the relevant /proc files. Section 12.1 provides further general information on this file system. The /proc file system is not specified by any standards, and the details that we describe are Linux-specific.</SPAN>
