<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A pseudoterminal is a pair of connected virtual devices, known as the master and slave. This device pair provides an IPC channel allowing data to be transferred in both directions between the two devices.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The key point about a pseudoterminal is that the slave device provides an interface that behaves like a terminal, which makes it possible to connect a terminal-oriented program to the slave device and then use another program connected to the master device to drive the terminal-oriented program. Output written by the driver program undergoes the usual input processing performed by the terminal driver (for example, in the default mode, a carriage return is mapped to a newline) and is then passed as input to the terminal-oriented program connected to the slave. Anything that the terminal-oriented program writes to the slave is passed (after performing all of the usual terminal output processing) as input to the driver program. In other words, the driver program is performing the function normally performed by the user at a conventional terminal.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Pseudoterminals are used in a variety of applications, most notably in the implementation of terminal windows provided under an X Window System login and in applications providing network login services, such as telnet and ssh.</SPAN>
