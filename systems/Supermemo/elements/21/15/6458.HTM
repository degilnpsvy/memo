<H3 style="MARGIN: 13pt 0cm"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 22pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 173%; mso-bidi-font-size: 16.0pt">File ownership and permissions</SPAN></H3>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Each file has an associated user ID and group ID that define the owner of the file and the group to which it belongs. The ownership of a file is used to determine the access rights available to users of the file.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">For the purpose of accessing a file, the system divides users into three categories: the owner of the file (sometimes termed the user of the file), users who are members of the group matching the file&#8217;s group ID (group), and the rest of the world (other). Three permission bits may be set for each of these categories of user (making a total of nine permission bits): read permission allows the contents of the file to be read; write permission allows modification of the contents of the file; and execute permission allows execution of the file, which is either a program or a script to be processed by some interpreter (usually, but not always, one of the shells).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">These permissions may also be set on directories, although their meanings are slightly different: read permission allows the contents of (i.e., the filenames in) the directory to be listed; write permission allows the contents of the directory to be changed (i.e., filenames can be added, removed, and changed); and execute(sometimes called search) permission allows access to files within the directory (subject to the permissions on the files themselves).</SPAN>
