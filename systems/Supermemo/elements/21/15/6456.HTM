<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A pathname is a string consisting of an optional initial slash (/) followed by a series of filenames separated by slashes. All but the last of these component filenames identifies a directory (or a symbolic link that resolves to a directory). The last component of a pathname may identify any type of file, including a directory. The series of component filenames preceding the final slash is sometimes referred to as the directory part of a pathname, while the name following the final slash is sometimes referred to as the file or base part of the pathname.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A pathname is read from left to right; each filename resides in the directory specified by the preceding part of the pathname. The string ..can be used anywhere in a pathname to refer to the parent of the location so far specified in the pathname.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A pathname describes the location of a file within the single directory hierarchy, and is either absolute or relative:</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">z An absolute pathname begins with a slash (/) and specifies the location of a file with respect to the root directory. Examples of absolute pathnames for files in Figure 2-1 are /home/mtk/.bashrc, /usr/include, and /(the pathname of the root directory).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">z A relative pathname specifies the location of a file relative to a process&#8217;s current working directory (see below), and is distinguished from an absolute pathname by the absence of an initial slash. In Figure 2-1, from the directory usr, the file types.h could be referenced using the relative pathname include/sys/types.h, while from the directory avr, the file .bashrc could be accessed using the relative pathname ../mtk/.bashrc.</SPAN>
