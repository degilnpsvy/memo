<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">On most Linux file systems, filenames can be up to 255 characters long. Filenames may contain any characters except slashes (/) and null characters (\0). However, it is advisable to employ only letters and digits, and the .(period), _(underscore), and -(hyphen) characters. This 65-character set, [-._a-zA-Z0-9], is referred to in SUSv3 as the portable filename character set.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We should avoid the use of characters in filenames that are not in the portable filename character set because those characters may have special meanings within the shell, within regular expressions, or in other contexts. If a filename containing characters with special meanings appears in such contexts, then these characters must be escaped; that is, specially marked&#8212;typically with a preceding backslash (\)&#8212;to indicate that they should not be interpreted with those special meanings. In contexts where no escape mechanism is available, the filename is not usable.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We should also avoid filenames beginning with a hyphen (-), since such filenames may be mistaken for options when specified in a shell command.</SPAN>
