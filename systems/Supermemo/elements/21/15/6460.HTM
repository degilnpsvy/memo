<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The I/O system calls refer to open files using a file descriptor, a (usually small) nonnegative integer. A file descriptor is typically obtained by a call to open(), which takes a pathname argument specifying a file upon which I/O is to be performed. </SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Normally, a process inherits three open file descriptors when it is started by the shell: descriptor 0 is standard input, the file from which the process takes its input; descriptor 1 is standard output, the file to which the process writes its output; and descriptor 2 is standard error, the file to which the process writes error messages and notification of exceptional or abnormal conditions. In an interactive shell or program, these three descriptors are normally connected to the terminal. In the stdio library, these descriptors correspond to the file streams stdin, stdout, and stderr.</SPAN>
