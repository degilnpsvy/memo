<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A directory is a special file whose contents take the form of a table of filenames coupled with references to the corresponding files. This filename-plus-reference association is called a link, and files may have multiple links, and thus multiple names, in the same or in different directories.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Directories may contain links both to files and to other directories. The links between directories establish the directory hierarchy shown in Figure 2-1.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Every directory contains at least two entries: .(dot), which is a link to the directory itself, and ..(dot-dot), which is a link to its parent directory, the directory above it in the hierarchy. Every directory, exceptthe root directory, has a parent. For the root directory, the dot-dot entry is a link to the root directory itself (thus, /..equates to /).</SPAN>
