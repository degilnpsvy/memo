<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Each process has a current working directory(sometimes just referred to as the process&#8217;s working directory or current directory). This is the process&#8217;s &#8220;current location&#8221; within the single directory hierarchy, and it is from this directory that relative pathnames are interpreted for the process. </SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A process inherits its current working directory from its parent process. A login shell has its initial current working directory set to the location named in the home directory field of the user&#8217;s password file entry. The shell&#8217;s current working directory can be changed with the cd command.</SPAN>
