<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Like a normal link, a symbolic link provides an alternative name for a file. But whereas a normal link is a filename-plus-pointer entry in a directory list, a symbolic link is a specially marked file containing the name of another file. (In other words, a symbolic link has a filename-plus-pointer entry in a directory, and the file referred to by the pointer contains a string that names another file.) This latter file is often</SPAN></P>

When a pathname is specified in a system call, in most circumstances, the kernel automatically dereferences(or synonymously, follows) each symbolic link in the pathname, replacing it with the filename to which it points. This process may happen recursively if the target of a symbolic link is itself a symbolic link. (The kernel imposes limits on the number of dereferences to handle the possibility of circular chains of symbolic links.) If a symbolic link refers to a file that doesn&#8217;t exist, it is said to be a dangling link.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Often hard link and soft link are used as alternative terms for normal and symbolic links. The reasons for having two different types of links are explained in Chapter 18.</SPAN>
