You&#8217;ll also likely find the git diff command useful during staging. (Diffs are discussed extensively in Chapter 8.) This command can display two different sets of changes: <FONT class=extract>git diff displays the changes that remain in your working directory and are not staged</FONT>; <FONT class=extract>git diff --cached shows changes that are staged and will therefore contribute to your next commit</FONT>.
