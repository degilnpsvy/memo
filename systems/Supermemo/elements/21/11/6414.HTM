<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">January 1979 saw the release of Seventh Edition UNIX, which improved the reliability of the system and provided an enhanced file system. This release also contained a number of new tools, including awk, make, sed, tar, uucp, the Bourne shell, and a FORTRAN 77 compiler. The release of Seventh Edition is also significant because, from this point, UNIX diverged into two important variants: BSD and System V, whose origins we now briefly describe.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Thompson spent the 1975/1976 academic year as a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, the university from which he had graduated. There, he worked with several graduate students, adding many new features to UNIX. (One of these students, Bill Joy, subsequently went on to cofound Sun Microsystems, an early entry in the UNIX workstation market.) Over time, many new tools and features were developed at Berkeley, including the C shell, the vi editor, an improved file system (the Berkeley Fast File System), send mail, a Pascal compiler, and virtual memory manage menton the new Digital VAX architecture.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Under the name Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), this version of UNIX, including its source code, came to be widely distributed. The first full distribution was 3BSD in December 1979. (Earlier releases from Berkeley&#8212;BSD and 2BSD&#8212;were distributions of new tools produced at Berkeley, rather than complete UNIX distributions.)</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In 1983, the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley released 4.2BSD. This release was significant because it contained a complete TCP/IP implementation, including the sockets application programming interface (API) and a variety of networking tools. 4.2BSD and its predecessor 4.1BSD became widely distributed within universities around the world. They also formed the basis for SunOS (first releasedin 1983), the UNIX variant sold by Sun. Other significant BSD releases were 4.3BSD, in 1986, and the final release, 4.4BSD, in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>The very first ports of the UNIX system to hardware other than the PDP-11 occurred during 1977 and 1978, when Dennis Ritchie and Steve Johnson ported it to the Interdata 8/32 and Richard Miller at the University of Wollongong in Australia simultaneously ported it to the Interdata 7/32. The Berkeley Digital VAX port was based on an earlier (1978) port by John Reiser and Tom London. Known as 32V, this port was essentially the same as Seventh Edition for the PDP-11, except for the larger address space and wider data types.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In the meantime, US antitrust legislation forced the breakup of AT&amp;T (legal maneuvers began in the mid-1970s, and the breakup became effective in 1982), with the consequence that, since it no longer held a monopoly on the telephone system, the company was permitted to market UNIX. This resulted in the release of System III (three) in 1981. System III was produced by AT&amp;T&#8217;s UNIX Support Group (USG), which employed many hundreds of developers to enhance UNIX and develop UNIX applications (notably, document preparation packages and software development tools). The first release of System V (five) followed in 1983, and a series of releases led to the definitive System V Release 4 (SVR4) in 1989, by which time System V had incorporated many features from BSD, including networking facilities. System V was licensed to a variety of commercial vendors, who used it as the basis of their UNIX implementations.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Thus, in addition to the various BSD distributions spreading through academia, by the late 1980s, UNIX was available in a range of commercial implementations on various hardware. These implementations included Sun&#8217;s SunOS and later Solaris, Digital&#8217;s Ultrix and OSF/1 (nowadays, after a series of renamings and acquisitions, HP Tru64 UNIX), IBM&#8217;s AIX, Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s (HP&#8217;s) HP-UX, NeXT&#8217;s NeXTStep, A/UX for the Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft and SCO&#8217;s XENIX for the Intel x86-32 architecture. (Throughout this book, the Linux implementation for x86-32 is referred to as Linux/x86-32.) This situation was in sharp contrast to the typical proprietary hardware/operating system scenarios of the time, where each vendor produced one, or at most a few, proprietary computer chip architectures, on which they sold their own proprietary operating system(s). The proprietary nature of most vendor systems meant that purchasers were locked into one vendor. Switching to another proprietary operating system and hardware platform could become very expensive because of the need to port existing applications and retrain staff. This factor, coupled with the appearance of cheap single user UNIX workstations from a variety of vendors, made the portable UNIX system increasingly attractive from a commercial perspective.</SPAN>
