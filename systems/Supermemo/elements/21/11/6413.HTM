<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Between 1969 and 1979, UNIX went through a number of releases, known as editions. Essentially, these releases were snapshots of the evolving development version at AT&amp;T. [Salus, 1994] notes the following dates for the first six editions of UNIX:</SPAN></P>

<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Over the period of these releases, the use and reputation of UNIX began to spread, first within AT&amp;T, and then beyond. An important contribution to this growing awareness was the publication of a paper on UNIX in the widely read journal Communications of the ACM([Ritchie &amp; Thompson, 1974]).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">At this time, AT&amp;T held a government-sanctioned monopoly on the US telephone system. The terms of AT&amp;T&#8217;s agreement with the US government prevented it from selling software, which meant that it could not sell UNIX as a product. Instead, beginning in 1974 with Fifth Edition, and especially with Sixth Edition, AT&amp;T licensed UNIX for use in universities for a nominal distribution fee. The university distributions included documentation and the kernel source code (about 10,000 lines at the time).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">AT&amp;T&#8217;s release of UNIX into universities greatly contributed to the popularity and use of the operating system, and by 1977, UNIX was running at some 500 sites, including 125 universities in the United States and several other countries. UNIX offered universities an interactive multiuser operating system that was cheap yet powerful, at a time when commercial operating systems were very expensive. It also gave university computer science departments the source code of a real operating system, which they could modify and offer to their students to learn from and experiment with. Some of these students, armed with UNIX knowledge, became UNIX evangelists. Others went on to found or join the multitude of startup companies selling inexpensive computer workstations running the easily ported UNIX operating system.</SPAN>
