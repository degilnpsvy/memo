<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Linux is a member of the UNIX family of operating systems. In computing terms, UNIX has a long history. The first part of this chapter provides a brief outline of that history. We begin with a description of the origins of the UNIX system and the C programming language, and then consider the two key currents that led to the Linux system as it exists today: the GNU project and the development of the Linux kernel.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">One of the notable features of the UNIX system is that its development was not controlled by a single vendor or organization. Rather, many groups, both commercial and noncommercial, contributed to its evolution. This history resulted in many innovative features being added to UNIX, but also had the negative consequence that UNIX implementations diverged over time, so that writing applications that worked on all UNIX implementations became increasingly difficult. This led to a drive for standardization of UNIX implementations, which we discuss in the second part of this chapter.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>Two definitions of the term UNIX are in common use. One of these denotes operating systems that have passed the official conformance tests for the Single UNIX Specification and thus are officially granted the right to be branded as &#8220;UNIX&#8221; by The Open Group (the holders of the UNIX trademark). At the time of writing, none of the free UNIX implementations (e.g., Linux and FreeBSD) has obtained this branding.</EM></SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>The other common meaning attached to the term UNIX denotes those systems that look and behave like classical UNIX systems (i.e., the original Bell Laboratories UNIX and its later principal offshoots, System V and BSD). By this definition, Linux is generally considered to be a UNIX system (as are the modern BSDs). Although we give close attention to the Single UNIX Specification in this book, we&#8217;ll follow this second definition of UNIX, so that we&#8217;ll often say things such as &#8220;Linux, like other UNIX implementations. . . .&#8221;</EM></SPAN>
