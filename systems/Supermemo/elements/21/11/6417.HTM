<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student at the University of Helsinki, was inspired to write an operating system for his Intel 80386 PC. In the course of his studies, Torvalds had come into contact with Minix, a small UNIX-like operating system kernel developed in the mid-1980s by Andrew Tanenbaum, a university professor in Holland. Tanenbaum made Minix, complete with source code, available as a tool for teaching operating system design in university courses. The Minix kernel could be built and run on a 386 system. However, since its primary purpose was as a teaching tool, it was designed to be largely independent of the hardware architecture, and it did not take full advantage of the 386 processor&#8217;s capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Torvalds therefore started on a project to create an efficient, full-featured UNIX kernel to run on the 386. Over a few months, Torvalds developed a basic kernel that allowed him to compile and run various GNU programs. Then, on October 5, 1991, Torvalds requested the help of other programmers, making the following now much-quoted announcement of version 0.02 of his kernel in the comp.os.minix Usenet newsgroup:</SPAN></P>

Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth on a OS you can try to modify for your needs? Are you finding it frustrating when everything works on Minix? No more all-nighters to get a nifty program working? Then this post might be just for you. As I mentioned a month ago, I&#8217;m working on a free version of a Minix-look-alike for AT-386 computers. It has finally reached the stage where it&#8217;s even usable (though may not be depending on what you want), and I am willing to put out the sources for wider distribution. It is just version 0.02 . . . but I&#8217;ve successfully run bash, gcc, gnu-make, gnu-sed, compress, etc. under it.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Following a time-honored tradition of giving UNIX clones names ending with the letter X, the kernel was (eventually) baptized Linux. Initially, Linux was placed under a more restrictive license, but Torvalds soon made it available under the GNU GPL.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The call for support proved effective. Other programmers joined Torvalds in the development of Linux, adding various features, such as an improved file system, networking support, device drivers, and multiprocessor support. By March 1994, the developers were able to release version 1.0. Linux 1.2 appeared in March 1995, Linux 2.0 in June 1996, Linux 2.2 in January 1999, and Linux 2.4 in January 2001. Work on the 2.5 development kernel began in November 2001, and led to the release of Linux 2.6 in December 2003.</SPAN>
