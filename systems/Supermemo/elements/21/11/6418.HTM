<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It is worth noting that another free UNIX was already available for the x86-32 during the early 1990s. Bill and Lynne Jolitzhad developed a port of the already mature BSD system for the x86-32, known as386/BSD. This port was based on the BSD Net/2 release ( June 1991), a version of the 4.3BSD source code in which all remaining proprietary AT&amp;T source code had either been replaced or, in the case of six source code files that could not be trivially rewritten, removed. The Jolitzes ported the Net/2 code to x86-32, rewrote the missing source files, and made the first release (version 0.0) of 386/BSD in February 1992.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">After an initial wave of success and popularity, work on 386/BSD lagged for various reasons. In the face of an increasingly large backlog of patches, two alternative development groups soon appeared, creating their own releases based on 386/BSD: NetBSD, which emphasizes portability to a wide range of hardware platforms, and FreeBSD, which emphasizes performance and is the most widespread of the modern BSDs. The first NetBSD release was 0.8, in April 1993. The first FreeBSD CD-ROM (version 1.0) appeared in December 1993. Another BSD, OpenBSD, appeared in 1996 (as an initial version numbered 2.0) after forking from the NetBSD project. OpenBSD emphasizes security. In mid-2003, a new BSD, DragonFly BSD, appeared after a split from FreeBSD 4.x. DragonFly BSD takes a different approach from FreeBSD 5.xwith respect to design for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) architectures.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Probably no discussion of the BSDs in the early 1990s is complete without mention of the lawsuits between UNIX System Laboratories (USL, the AT&amp;T subsidiary spun off to develop and market UNIX) and Berkeley. In early 1992, the company Berkeley Software Design, Incorporated (BSDi, nowadays part of Wind River) began distributing a commercially supported BSD UNIX, BSD/OS, based on the Net/2 release and the Jolitzes&#8217; 386/BSD additions. BSDi distributed binaries and source code for $995 (US dollars), and advised potential customers to use their telephone number 1-800-ITS-UNIX.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In April 1992, USL filed suit against BSDi in an attempt to prevent BSDi from selling a product that USL claimed was still encumbered by proprietary USL source code and trade secrets. USL also demanded that BSDi cease using the deceptive telephone number. The suit was eventually widened to include a claim against the University of California. The court ultimately dismissed all but two of USL&#8217;s claims, and a countersuit by the University of California against USL ensued, in which the university claimed that USL had not given due credit for the use of BSD code in System V.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">While these suits were pending, USL was acquired by Novell, whose CEO, the late Ray Noorda, stated publicly that he would prefer to compete in the marketplace rather than in the court. Settlement was finally reached in January 1994, with the University of California being required to remove 3 of the 18,000 files in the Net/2 release, make some minor changes to a few other files, and add USL copyright notices to around 70 other files, which the university nevertheless could continue to distribute freely. This modified system was released as 4.4BSD-Lite in June 1994. (The last release from the university was 4.4BSD-Lite, Release 2 in June 1995.) At this point, the terms of the legal settlement required BSDi, FreeBSD, and NetBSD to replace their Net/2 base with the modified 4.4BSD-Lite source code. As [McKusick et al., 1996] notes, although this caused some delay in the development of the BSD derivatives, it also had the positive effect that these systems resynchronized with the three years of development work done by the university&#8217;s Computer Systems Research Group since the release of Net/2.</SPAN>
