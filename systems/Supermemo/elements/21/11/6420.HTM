<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">During the initial development of Linux, efficient implementation on the Intel 80386 was the primary goal, rather than portability to other processor architectures. However, with the increasing popularity of Linux, ports to other processor architectures began to appear, starting with an early port to the Digital Alpha chip.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The list of hardware architectures to which Linux has been ported continues to grow and includes x86-64, Motorola/IBM PowerPC and PowerPC64, Sun SPARC and SPARC64 (UltraSPARC), MIPS, ARM (Acorn), IBM zSeries (formerly System/390), Intel IA-64 (Itanium; see [Mosberger &amp; Eranian, 2002]), Hitachi SuperH, HP PA-RISC, and Motorola 68000.</SPAN>
