<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In 1984, Richard Stallman, an exceptionally talented programmer who had been working at MIT, set to work on creating a &#8220;free&#8221; UNIX implementation. Stallman&#8217;s outlook was a moral one, and free was defined in a legal sense, rather than a financial sense (see http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). Nevertheless, the legal freedom that Stallman described carried with it the implicit consequence that software such as operating systems would be available at no or very low cost.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Stallman militated against the legal restrictions placed on proprietary operating systems by computer vendors. These restrictions meant that purchasers of computer software in general could not see the source code of the software they were buying, and they certainly could not copy, change, or redistribute it. He pointed out that such a framework encouraged programmers to compete with each other and hoard their work, rather than to cooperate and share it.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In response, Stallman started the GNU project (a recursively defined acronym for &#8220;GNU&#8217;s not UNIX&#8221;) to develop an entire, freely available, UNIX-like system, consisting of a kernel and all associated software packages, and encouraged others to join him. In 1985, Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation (FSF), a nonprofit organization to support the GNU project as well as the development of free software in general.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>When the GNU project was started, BSD was not free in the sense that Stallman meant. Use of BSD still required a license from AT&amp;T, and users could not freely modify and redistribute the AT&amp;T code that formed part of BSD.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">One of the important results of the GNU project was the development of the GNU General Public License(GPL), the legal embodiment of Stallman&#8217;s notion of free software. Much of the software in a Linux distribution, including the kernel, is licensed under the GPL or one of a number of similar licenses. Software licensed under the GPL must be made available in source code form, and must be freely redistributable under the terms of the GPL. Modifications to GPL-licensed software are freely permitted, but any distribution of such modified software must also be under the terms of the GPL. If the modified software is distributed in executable form, the author must also allow any recipients the option of obtaining the modified source for no more than the cost of distribution. The first version of the GPL was released in 1989. The current version of the license, version 3, was released in 2007. Version 2 of the license, released in 1991, remains in wide use, and is the license used for the Linux kernel. (Discussions of various free software licenses can be found in [St. Laurent, 2004] and [Rosen, 2005].)</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The GNU project did not initially produce a working UNIX kernel, but did produce a wide range of other programs. Since these programs were designed to run on a UNIX-like operating system, they could be, and were, used on existing UNIX implementations and, in some cases, even ported to other operating systems. Among the more well-known programs produced by the GNU project are the Emacs text editor, GCC(originally the GNU C compiler, but now renamed the GNU compiler collection, comprising compilers for C, C++, and other languages), the bashshell, and glibc(the GNU C library).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">By the early 1990s, the GNU project had produced a system that was virtually complete, except for one important component: a working UNIX kernel. The GNU project had started work on an ambitious kernel design, known as the GNU/HURD, based on the Mach microkernel. However, the HURD was far from being in a form that could be released. (At the time of writing, work continues on the HURD, which currently runs only on the x86-32 architecture.)</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>Because a significant part of the program code that constitutes what is commonly known as the Linux system actually derives from the GNU project, Stallman prefers to use the term GNU/Linux to refer to the entire system. The question of naming (Linux versus GNU/Linux) is the source of some debate in the free software community. Since this book is primarily concerned with the API of the Linux kernel, we&#8217;ll generally use the term Linux.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The stage was set. All that was required was a working kernel to go with the otherwise complete UNIX system already produced by the GNU project.</SPAN>
