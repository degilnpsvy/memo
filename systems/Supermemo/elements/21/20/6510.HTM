Blobs </P>
<P>Each version of a file is represented as a blob. Blob, a contraction of &#8220;binary large object,&#8221; is a term that&#8217;s commonly used in computing to refer to some variable or file that can contain any data and whose internal structure is ignored by the program. A blob is treated as being opaque. A blob holds a file&#8217;s data but does not contain any metadata about the file or even its name.
