Let&#8217;s commit an alteration to the index.html file. Open the file, convert it to HTML, and save the file.

<P>$ cd ~/public_html </P>
<P># edit the index.html file </P>
<P>$ cat index.html </P>
<P>... My web site is alive! ... </P>
<P>$<FONT class=clozed> git commit index.html</FONT></P>
<P>If you are already somewhat familiar with Git, you may be tempted to think &#8220;Aha! You need to git add index.html before you can commit that file!&#8221; But that isn&#8217;t true. Because the file was already added to the repository (in &#8220;Adding a File to Your Repository&#8221; on page 22), there&#8217;s no need to tell the index about the file; it already knows. Furthermore, file changes are captured when directly committing a file named on the command line! Using a generic git commit without naming the file would not have worked in this case.
