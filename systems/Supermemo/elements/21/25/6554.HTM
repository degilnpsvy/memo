Using git mv 
<P></P>
<P>Suppose you need to move or rename a file. You may use a combination of git rm on the old file and git add on the new file, or you may use git mv directly. Given a repository with a file named stuff that you want to rename newstuff, the following sequences of commands are equivalent Git operations: </P>
<P>$ mv stuff newstuff </P>
<P>$ git rm stuff </P>
<P>$ git add newstuff </P>
<P>and </P>
<P>$ <FONT class=clozed>git mv stuff newstuff</FONT>
