<FONT class=extract>Because a .gitignore is treated as a regular file within your repository, it is copied during clone operations and applies to all copies of your repository. In general, you should place entries into your version controlled .gitignore files only if the patterns apply to all derived repositories universally.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>If the exclusion pattern is somehow specific to your one repository and should not (or might not) be applicable to anyone else&#8217;s clone of your repository, then the patterns should instead go into the<FONT class=clozed> .git/info/exclude</FONT> file, because it is not propagated during clone operations. Its pattern format and treatment is the same as .gitignore files.
