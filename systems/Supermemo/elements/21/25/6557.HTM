<FONT class=extract>Furthermore, Git allows you to have a .gitignore file in any directory within your repository. Each file affects its directory and all subdirectories.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The .gitignore rules also cascade: you can override the rules in a higher directory by including an inverted pattern (using the initial !) in one of the subdirectories.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>To resolve a hierarchy with multiple .gitignore directories, and to allow command-line addenda to the list of ignored files, Git honors the following precedence, from highest to lowest:</P>
<P>? Patterns specified on the command line. </P>
<P>? Patterns read from .gitignore in the same directory. </P>
<P>? Patterns in parent directories, proceeding upward. Hence, the current directory&#8217;s patterns overrule the parents&#8217; patterns, and the parents close to the current directory take precedence over higher parents. </P>
<P>? Patterns from the .git/info/exclude file. </P>
<P>? Patterns from the file specified by the configuration variable core.exclude file.
