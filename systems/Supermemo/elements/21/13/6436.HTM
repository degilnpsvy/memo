<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As a general goal, Linux (i.e., kernel, glibc, and tool) development aims to conform to the various UNIX standards, especially POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification. However, at the time of writing, no Linux distributions are branded as</SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: &#23435;&#20307;; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ascii-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-hansi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">&#8220;</SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">UNIX&#8221; by The Open Group. The problems are time and expense. Each vendor distribution would need to undergo conformance testing to obtain this branding, and it would need to repeat this testing with each new distribution release. Nevertheless, it is the de facto near-conformance to various standards that has enabled Linux to be so successful in the UNIX market.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">With most commercial UNIX implementations, the same company both develops and distributes the operating system. With Linux, things are different, in that implementation is separate from distribution, and multiple organizations&#8212;both commercial and noncommercial&#8212;handle Linux distribution.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Linus Torvalds doesn&#8217;t contribute to or endorse a particular Linux distribution. However, in terms of other individuals carrying out Linux development, the situation is more complex. Many developers working on the Linux kernel and on other free software projects are employed by various Linux distribution companies or work for companies (such as IBM and HP) with a strong interest in Linux. While these companies can influence the direction in which Linux moves by allocating programmer hours to certain projects, none of them controls Linux as such. And, of course, many of the other contributors to the Linux kernel and GNU projects work voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>At the time of writing, Torvalds is employed as a fellow at the Linux Foundation (http://www.linux-foundation.org/; formerly the Open Source Development Laboratory, OSDL), a nonprofit consortium of commercial and noncommercial organizations chartered to foster the growth of Linux.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Because there are multiple Linux distributors and because the kernel implementers don&#8217;t control the contents of distributions, there is no &#8220;standard&#8221; commercial Linux as such. Each Linux distributor&#8217;s kernel offering is typically based on a snapshot of the mainline (i.e., the Torvalds) kernel at a particular point in time, with a number of patches applied.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">These patches typically provide features that, to a greater or lesser extent, are deemed commercially desirable, and thus able to provide competitive differentiation in the marketplace. In some cases, these patches are later accepted into the mainline kernel. In fact, some new kernel features were initially developed by a distribution company, and appeared in their distribution before eventually being integrated into the mainline. For example, version 3 of the Reiserfs journaling file system was part of some Linux distributions long before it was accepted into the mainline 2.4 kernel.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The upshot of the preceding points is that there are (mostly minor) differences in the systems offered by the various Linux distribution companies. On a much smaller scale, this is reminiscent of the splits in implementations that occurred in the early years of UNIX. The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is an effort to ensure compatibility among the various Linux distributions. To do this, the LSB (http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB) develops and promotes a set of standards for Linux systems with the aim of ensuring that binary applications (i.e., compiled programs) can run on any LSB-conformant system.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>The binary portability promoted by the LSB contrasts with the source code portability promoted by POSIX. Source code portability means that we can write a C program and then successfully compile and run it on any POSIX conformant system. Binary compatibility is much more demanding and is generally not feasible across different hardware platforms. It allows us to compile a program once for a given hardware platform, and then run that compiled program on any conformant implementation running on that hardware platform. Binary portability is an essential requirement for the commercial viability of independent software vendor (ISV) applications built for Linux.</EM></SPAN>
