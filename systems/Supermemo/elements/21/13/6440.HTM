The kernel does this by providing a software layer to manage the limited resources of a computer. The Linux kernel executable typically resides at the pathname /boot/vmlinuz, or something similar. The derivation of this filename is historical. On early UNIX implementations, the kernel was called unix. Later UNIX implementations, which implemented virtual memory, renamed the kernel as vmunix. On Linux, the filename mirrors the system name, with the z replacing the final x to signify that the kernel is a compressed executable.</EM></SPAN>
