<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Figure 1-1 summarizes the relationships between the various standards described in the preceding sections, and places the standards in chronological order. In this diagram, the solid lines indicate direct descent between standards, and the dashed arrows indicate cases where one standard influenced another standard, was incorporated as part of another standard, or simply deferred to another standard.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The situation with networking standards is somewhat complex. Standardization efforts in this area began in the late 1980s with the formation of the POSIX 1003.12 committee to standardize the sockets API, the X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) API (an alternative network programming API based on System V&#8217;s Transport Layer Interface), and various associated APIs. The gestation of this standard occurred over several years, during which time POSIX 1003.12 was renamed POSIX 1003.1g. It was ratified in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In parallel with the development of POSIX 1003.1g, X/Open was also developing its X/Open Networking Specification (XNS). The first version of this specification, XNS Issue 4, was part of the first version of the Single UNIX Specification. It was succeeded by XNS Issue 5, which formed part of SUSv2. XNS Issue 5 was essentially the same as the then current (6.6) draft of POSIX.1g. This was followed by XNS Issue 5.2, which differed from XNS Issue 5 and the ratified POSIX.1g standard in marking the XTI API as obsolete and in including coverage of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), which was being designed in the mid-1990s). XNS Issue 5.2 formed the basis for the networking material included in SUSv3, and is thus now superseded. For similar reasons, POSIX.1g was withdrawn as a standard soon after it was ratified.</SPAN></P>
