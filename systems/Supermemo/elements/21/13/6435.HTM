<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In addition to the standards produced by independent or multiparty groups, reference is sometimes made to the two implementation standards defined by the final BSD release (4.4BSD) and AT&amp;T&#8217;s System V Release 4 (SVR4). The latter implementation standard was formalized by AT&amp;T&#8217;s publication of the System V Interface Definition (SVID). In 1989, AT&amp;T published Issue 3 of the SVID, which defined the interface that a UNIX implementation must provide in order to be able to call itself System V Release 4. (The SVID is available online at http://www.sco.com/developers/devspecs/.)</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>Because the behavior of some system calls and library functions varies between SVR4 and BSD, many UNIX implementations provide compatibility libraries and conditional-compilation facilities that emulate the behavior of whichever UNIX flavor is not used as the base for that particular implementation (see Section 3.6.1). This eases the burden of porting an application from another UNIX implementation.</EM></SPAN>
