<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Programs normally exist in two forms. The first form is source code, human-readable text consisting of a series of statements written in a programming language such as C. To be executed, source code must be converted to the second form: binary machine-language instructions that the computer can understand. (This contrasts with a script, which is a text file containing commands to be directly processed by a program such as a shell or other command interpreter.) The two meanings of the term program are normally considered synonymous, since the step of compiling and linking converts source code into semantically equivalent binary machine code. </SPAN>
