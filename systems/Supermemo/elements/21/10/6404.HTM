<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Throughout this book, I&#8217;ve taken special care to consider portability issues. You&#8217;ll find frequent references to relevant standards, especially the combined POSIX.1-2001 and Single UNIX Specification version 3 (SUSv3) standard. You&#8217;ll also find details about changes in the recent revision of that standard, the combined POSIX.1-2008 and SUSv4 standard. (Because SUSv3 was a much larger revision, and it is the UNIX standard that is in most widespread effect at the time of writing, discussions of standards in the book are generally framed in terms of SUSv3, with notes on the differences in SUSv4. However, you can assume that, except where noted, statements about specifications in SUSv3 also hold true in SUSv4.)</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">For features that are not standardized, I indicate the range of differences on other UNIX implementations. I also highlight those major features of Linux that are implementation-specific, as well as minor differences between the implementation of system calls and library functions on Linux and other UNIX implementations.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Where a feature is not indicated as being Linux-specific, you can normally assume that it is a standard feature that appears on most or all UNIX implementations. I&#8217;ve tested most of the example programs presented in this book (other than those that exploit features that are noted as being Linux-specific) on some or all of Solaris, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Tru64 UNIX, and HP-UX. To improve portability to some of these systems, the web site for this book provides alternative versions of certain example programs with extra code that doesn&#8217;t appear in the book. </SPAN>
