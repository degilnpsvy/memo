<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Although the example programs are written in C, you can use the interfaces described in this book from other programming languages&#8212;for example, compiled languages such as C++, Pascal, Modula, Ada, FORTRAN, D, and scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby. (Java requires a different approach; see, for example, [Rochkind, 2004].) Different techniques will be required to obtain the necessary constant definitions and function declarations (except in the case of C++), and some extra work may be needed to pass function arguments in the manner required by C linkage conventions. Notwithstanding these differences, the essential concepts are the same, and you&#8217;ll find the information in this book is applicable even if you are working in another programming language.</SPAN>
