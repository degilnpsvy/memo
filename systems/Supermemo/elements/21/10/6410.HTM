<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I welcome bug reports, suggestions for code improvements, and fixes to further improve code portability. Book bugs and general suggestions about how the explanations in the book can be improved are also welcome. Since changes in the Linux programming interface are varied and sometimes too frequent for one person to keep up with, I would be happy to receive suggestions about new and changed features that should be covered in a future edition of this book. </SPAN></P>
