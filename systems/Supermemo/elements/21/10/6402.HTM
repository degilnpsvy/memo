<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I illustrate the use of most of the interfaces described in this book with short, complete programs, many of which are designed to allow you to easily experiment from the command line to see just how various system calls and library functions work.Consequently, this book contains a lot of example code&#8212;around 15,000 lines of C source code and shell session logs.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Although reading and experimenting with the example programs is a useful starting point, the most effective way to consolidate the concepts discussed in this book is to write code, either modifying the example programs to try out your own ideas or writing new programs.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">All of the source code in this book is available for download from the book&#8217;s web site. The source code distribution also includes many additional programs that don&#8217;t appear in the book. The purpose and details of these programs are described in comments in the source code. Makefiles are provided for building the programs, and an accompanying README file gives further details about the programs.</SPAN></P>
