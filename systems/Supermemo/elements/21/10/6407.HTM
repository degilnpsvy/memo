<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I started using UNIX and C in 1987, when I spent several weeks sitting in front of an HP Bobcat workstation with a copy of the first edition of Marc Rochkind&#8217;s Advanced UNIX Programming and what ultimately became a very dog-eared printed copy of the C shell manual page. My approach then was one that I still try to follow today, and that I recommend to anyone approaching a new software technology: take the time to read the documentation (if it exists) and write small (but increasingly large) test programs until you become confident of your understanding of the software. I&#8217;ve found that, in the long run, this kind of self-training more than pays for itself in terms of saved time. Many of the programming examples in this book are constructed in ways that encourage this learning approach.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I&#8217;ve primarily been a software engineer and designer. However, I&#8217;m also a passionate teacher, and have spent several years teaching in both academic and commercial environments. I&#8217;ve run many week-long courses teaching UNIX system programming, and that experience informs the writing of this book.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I&#8217;ve been using Linux for about half as long as I&#8217;ve been using UNIX, and, over that time, my interest has increasingly centered on the boundary between the kernel and user space: the Linux programming interface. This interest has drawn me into a number of interrelated activities. I intermittently provide input and bug reports for the POSIX/SUS standard; I carry out tests and design reviews of new user-space interfaces added to the Linux kernel (and have helped find and fix many code and design bugs in those interfaces); I&#8217;ve been a regular speaker at conferences on topics related to interfaces and their documentation; and I&#8217;ve been invited on a number of occasions to the annual Linux Kernel Developers Summit. The common thread tying all of these activities together is my most visible contribution in the Linux world: my work on the man-pages project (http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The man-pages project provides pages in sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the Linux manual pages. These are the manual pages describing the programming interfaces provided by the Linux kernel and the GNU C library&#8212;the same topic area as this book. I&#8217;ve been involved with man-pages for more than a decade. Since 2004, I&#8217;ve been the project maintainer, a task that involves, in roughly equal measure, writing documentation, reading kernel and library source code, and writing programs to verify the details for documentation. (Documenting an interface is a great way to find bugs in that interface.) I&#8217;ve also been the biggest contributor to man-pages&#8212;of the approximately 900 pages in man-pages, I am the author of 140, and the coauthor of another 125. So, even before you picked up this book, it&#8217;s quite likely you&#8217;ve read some of my published work. I hope that you&#8217;ve found that work useful, and that you&#8217;ll find this book even more so.</SPAN></P>

Riley Hoffman had overall responsibility for layout and design of the book, and also took up the reins as production editor as we came into the home straight. Riley graciously bore with my many requests to achieve the right layout and produced a superb final result. Thank you.</SPAN></P>
