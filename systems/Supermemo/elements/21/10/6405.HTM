<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The primary focus of this book is on Linux 2.6.x, the kernel version in widest use at the time of writing. Details for Linux 2.4 are also covered, and I&#8217;ve indicated where features differ between Linux 2.4 and 2.6.Where new features appear in the Linux 2.6.xseries, the exact kernel version number of their appearance (e.g., 2.6.34) is noted.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">With respect to the C library, the main focus is on the GNU C library (glibc) version 2. Where relevant, differences across glibc2.xversions are noted.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As this book was heading to press, Linux kernel version 2.6.35 had just been released, and glibc version 2.12 had been recently released. This book is current with respect to both of these software versions. Changes that occur in the Linux and glibc interfaces after publication of this book will be noted on the book&#8217;s web site.</SPAN>
