<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Historically, the SUS (and XPG) standards deferred to the corresponding POSIX standards and were structured as functional supersets of POSIX. As well as specifying additional interfaces, the SUS standards made mandatory many of the interfaces and behaviors that were deemed optional in POSIX.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This distinction survives somewhat more subtly in POSIX 1003.1-2001, which is both an IEEE standard and an Open Group Technical Standard (i.e., as noted already, it is a consolidation of earlier POSIX and SUS standards). This document defines two levels of conformance:</SPAN></P>

An implementation must reach this level of conformance in order to obtain the UNIX 03branding from The Open Group.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The additional interfaces and behaviors required for XSI conformance are collectively known as the XSI extension. They include support for features such as threads, mmap() and munmap(), the dlopen API, resource limits, pseudoterminals, System V IPC, the syslog API, poll(), and login accounting.</SPAN></P>
