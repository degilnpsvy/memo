<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Occasionally, we refer to an interface as being &#8220;unspecified&#8221; or &#8220;weakly specified&#8221; within SUSv3.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">By an unspecified interface, we mean one that is not defined at all in the formal standard, although in a few cases there are background notes or rationale text that mention the interface.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Saying that an interface is weakly specified is shorthand for saying that, while the interface is included in the standard, important details are left unspecified (commonly because the committee members could not reach an agreement due to differences in existing implementations).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">When using interfaces that are unspecified or weakly specified, we have few guarantees when porting applications to other UNIX implementations. Nevertheless, in a few cases, such an interface is quite consistent across implementations,</SPAN></P>
