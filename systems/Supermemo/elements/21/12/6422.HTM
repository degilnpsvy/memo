<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">By the late 1980s, the wide variety of available UNIX implementations also had its drawbacks. Some UNIX implementations were based on BSD, others were based on System V, and some drew features from both variants. Furthermore, each commercial vendor had added extra features to its own implementation. The consequence was that moving software and people from one UNIX implementation to another became steadily more difficult. This situation created strong pressure for standardization of the C programming language and the UNIX system, so that applications could more easily be ported from one system to another. We now look at the resulting standards.</SPAN>
