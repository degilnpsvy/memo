<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">X/Open Company was a consortium formed by an international group of computer vendors to adopt and adapt existing standards in order to produce a comprehensive, consistent set of open systems standards. It produced the X/Open Portability Guide, a series of portability guides based on the POSIX standards. The first important release of this guide was Issue 3 (XPG3) in 1989, followed by XPG4 in 1992. XPG4 was revised in 1994, which resulted in XPG4 version 2, a standard that also incorporated important parts of AT&amp;T&#8217;s System V Interface Definition Issue 3, described in Section 1.3.7. This revision was also known as Spec 1170, with 1170 referring to the number of interfaces&#8212;functions, header files, and commands&#8212;defined by the standard.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">When Novell, which acquired the UNIX systems business from AT&amp;T in early 1993, later divested itself of that business, it transferred the rights to the UNIX trademark to X/Open. (The plan to make this transfer was announced in 1993, but legal requirements delayed the transfer until early 1994.) XPG4 version 2 was subsequently repackaged as the Single UNIX Specification(SUS, or sometimes SUSv1), and is also known as UNIX 95. This repackaging included XPG4 version 2, the X/Open Curses Issue 4 version 2 specification, and the X/Open Networking Services (XNS) Issue 4 specification. Version 2 of the Single UNIX Specification (SUSv2, http://www.unix.org/version2/online.html) appeared in 1997, and UNIX implementations certified against this specification can call themselves UNIX 98. (This standard is occasionally also referred to as XPG5.)</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In 1996, X/Open merged with the Open Software Foundation (OSF) to form The Open Group. Nearly every company or organization involved with the UNIX system is now a member of The Open Group, which continues to develop API standards. </SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">OSF was one of two vendor consortia formed during the UNIX wars of the late 1980s. Among others, OSF included Digital, IBM, HP, Apollo, Bull, Nixdorf, and Siemens. OSF was formed primarily in response to the threat created by a business alliance between AT&amp;T (the originators of UNIX) and Sun (the most powerful player in the UNIX workstation market). Consequently, AT&amp;T, Sun, and other companies formed the rival UNIX International consortium.</SPAN>
