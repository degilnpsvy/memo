<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Precisely speaking, the term Linux refers just to the kernel developed by Linus Torvalds and others. However, the term Linux is commonly used to mean the kernel, plus a wide range of other software (tools and libraries) that together make a complete operating system. In the very early days of Linux, the user was required to assemble all of this software, create a file system, and correctly place and configure all of the software on that file system. This demanded considerable time and expertise. As a result, a market opened for Linux distributors, who created packages (distributions) to automate most of the installation process, creating a file system and installing the kernel and other required software.</SPAN></P>

The oldest surviving commercial distribution, Slackware, appeared in 1993. The noncommercial Debian distribution appeared at around the same time, and SUSE and Red Hat soon followed. The currently very popular Ubuntu distribution first appeared in 2004. Nowadays, many distribution companies also employ programmers who actively contribute to existing free software projects or initiate new projects.</SPAN>
