<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Beginning in 1999, the IEEE, The Open Group, and the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 collaborated in the Austin Common Standards Revision Group(CSRG, http://www.opengroup.org/austin/) with the aim of revising and consolidating the POSIX standards and the Single UNIX Specification. (The Austin Group is so named because its inaugural meeting was in Austin, Texas in September 1998.) This resulted in the ratification of POSIX 1003.1-2001, sometimes just called POSIX.1-2001, in December 2001 (subsequently approved as an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 9945:2002).</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">POSIX 1003.1-2001 replaces SUSv2, POSIX.1, POSIX.2, and a raft of other earlier POSIX standards. This standard is also known as the Single UNIX Specification Version 3, and we&#8217;ll generally refer to it in the remainder of this book as SUSv3.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The SUSv3 base specifications consists of around 3700 pages, divided into the</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">following four parts:</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings"><SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore">l<SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Base Definitions(XBD): This part contains definitions, terms, concepts, and specifications of the contents of header files. A total of 84 header file specifications are provided.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings"><SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore">l<SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">System Interfaces(XSH): This part begins with various useful background information. Its bulk consists of the specification of various functions (which are implemented as either system calls or library functions on specific UNIX implementations). A total of 1123 system interfaces are included in this part.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings"><SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore">l<SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Shell and Utilities(XCU): This specifies the operation of the shell and various UNIX commands. A total of 160 utilities are specified in this part.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Wingdings; mso-bidi-font-family: Wingdings"><SPAN style="mso-list: Ignore">l<SPAN style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Rationale(XRAT): This part includes informative text and justifications relating to the earlier parts.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In addition, SUSv3 includes the X/Open CURSES Issue 4 Version 2(XCURSES) specification, which specifies 372 functions and 3 header files for the curses screen handling API.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In all, 1742 interfaces are specified inSUSv3. By contrast, POSIX.1-1990 (with FIPS 151-2) specified 199 interfaces, and POSIX.2-1992 specified 130 utilities.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">SUSv3 is available online at http://www.unix.org/version3/online.html. UNIX implementations certified against SUSv3 can call themselves UNIX 03.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There have been various minor fixes and improvements for problems discovered since the ratification of the original SUSv3 text. These have resulted in the appearance of Technical Corrigendum Number 1, whose improvements were incorporated in a 2003 revision of SUSv3, and Technical Corrigendum Number 2, whose improvements were incorporated in a 2004 revision.</SPAN>
