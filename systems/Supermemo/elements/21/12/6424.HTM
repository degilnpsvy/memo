<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The term POSIX (an abbreviation of Portable Operating System Interface) refers to a group of standards developed under the auspices of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), specifically its Portable Application Standards Committee (PASC, http://www.pasc.org/). The goal of the PASC standards is to promote application portability at the source code level.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>The name POSIX was suggested by Richard Stallman. The final X appears because the names of most UNIX variants end in X. The standard notes that the name should be pronounced &#8220;pahz-icks,&#8221; like &#8220;positive.&#8221;</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The most interesting of the POSIX standards for our purposes are the first POSIX standard, referred to as POSIX.1 (or, more fully, POSIX 1003.1), and the subsequent POSIX.2 standard.</SPAN>
