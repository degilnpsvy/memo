<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">POSIX.1 became an IEEE standard in 1988 and, with minor revisions, was adopted as an ISO standard in 1990 (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990). (The original POSIX standards are not available online, but can be purchased from the IEEE at http://www.ieee.org/.)</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>POSIX.1 was initially based on an earlier (1984) unofficial standard produced by an association of UNIX vendors called /usr/group.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">POSIX.1 documents an API for a set of services that should be made available to a program by a conforming operating system. An operating system that does this can be certified as POSIX.1 conformant.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">POSIX.1 is based on the UNIX system call and the C library function API, but it doesn&#8217;t require any particular implementation to be associated with this interface. This means that the interface can be implemented by any operating system, not specifically a UNIX operating system. In fact, some vendors have added APIs to their proprietary operating systems that make them POSIX.1 conformant, while at the same time leaving the underlying operating system largely unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A number of extensions to the originalPOSIX.1 standard were also important. IEEE POSIX 1003.1b (POSIX.1b, formerly called POSIX.4 or POSIX 1003.4), ratified in 1993, contains a range of realtime extensions to the base POSIX standard. IEEE POSIX 1003.1c (POSIX.1c), ratified in 1995, is the definition of POSIX threads. In 1996, a revised version of the POSIX.1 standard (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996) was produced, leaving the core text unchanged, but incorporating the realtime and threads extensions. IEEE POSIX 1003.1g (POSIX.1g) defined the networking APIs, including sockets. IEEE POSIX 1003.1d (POSIX.1d), ratified in 1999, and POSIX.1j, ratified in 2000, defined additional realtime extensions to the POSIX base standard.</SPAN></P>
<P class=a style="MARGIN: 0cm 10.5pt 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><EM>The POSIX.1b realtime extensions include file synchronization; asynchronous I/O; process scheduling; high-precision clocks and timers; and interprocess communication using semaphores, shared memory, and message queues. The prefix POSIX is often applied to the three interprocess communication methods to distinguish them from the similar, but older, System V semaphores, shared memory, and message queues.</EM></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A related standard, POSIX.2 (1992, ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993), standardized the shell and various UNIX utilities, including the command-line interface of the C compiler.</SPAN>
