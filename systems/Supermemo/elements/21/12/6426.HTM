<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">FIPS is an abbreviation for Federal Information Processing Standard, the name of a set of standards specified by the US government for the purchase of its computer systems. In 1989, FIPS 151-1 was published. This standard was based on the 1988 IEEE POSIX.1 standard and the draft ANSI C standard. The main difference between FIPS 151-1 and POSIX.1 (1988) was that the FIPS standard required some features that POSIX.1 left as optional. Because the US government is a major purchaser of computer systems, most computer vendors ensured that their UNIX systems conformed to the FIPS151-1 version of POSIX.1.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">FIPS 151-2 aligned with the 1990 ISO edition of POSIX.1, but was otherwise unchanged. The now outdated FIPS151-2 was withdrawn as a standard in February 2000.</SPAN>
