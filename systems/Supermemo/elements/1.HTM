You should remember that all your learning material requires endless attention. You should review your elements for usefulness, correct formulation, logic, grammar, etc. <FONT class=extract>When an element comes up for a repetition, you should make a quick and nearly instinctive assessment of the following: </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>1.Do I really need this element? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>2.Do I really need to know it now? Or can I learn it later? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>3.Is this element difficult to remember? If so, why? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>4.Is it factually correct? </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>5.Is it as simple and clear as possible? </FONT></P>
<P>Here are some typical actions you will take depending on the answer to the above questions (some keyboard shortcuts may not work at lower difficulty levels): </P>
<P>1.correcting an element. <FONT class=extract>In case of questions and answers, you can use keys such as Q, A, or E to enter a text field and change it.</FONT> In more complex elements <FONT class=extract>you can use Ctrl+T to cycle between components</FONT>, or <FONT class=extract>use Alt+click to switch a component between editing and dragging modes</FONT> </P>
<P>2.rescheduling the element. You can manually change the date of the next review. If you know the element well, you can increase the interval remaining till the next review. If the element is very important, you can reduce the interval. <FONT class=extract>Press Ctrl+J to select the date of the next review</FONT>. <FONT class=extract>If you have just reviewed the element, you should instead use Shift+Ctrl+R to inform SuperMemo about the review</FONT> </P>
<P>3.dismissing an element. If you are sure you are not likely to need the element in the future, but you would like to keep it in your collection for reference or archival purposes, press Ctrl+D. Dismissed elements are removed from the learning process (and from the pending queue) </P>
<P>4.deleting the item or an article. <FONT class=extract>The key Del is very useful in cleaning your collection from garbage.</FONT> <FONT class=extract><FONT class=extract>Note that deleting an element also deletes its children.</FONT> This operation is irreversible.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>You can use Done with Shift+Ctrl+Enter to delete the content of an element without deleting its children</FONT> </P>
<P>5.forgetting an element. If you think the element is too difficult or not important enough at the moment, you can decide to learn it later. <FONT class=extract>For this purpose, press Ctrl+R to remove it from the learning process. This will put it at the end of the pending queue</FONT>
