How to judge the method "Increase the set associativity of the cache" for reduce the number of cache misses? 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>It&#8217;s worth going up to fourway but after that the gains in cache performance are too small to notice.( There are systems with eight-way or more caches, but that&#8217;s usually done for some reason other than reducing cache misses. Generous provision of cache ways can be good for power reduction (whole ways can be powered down when not being used) and can sometimes avoid cache aliases, as described in section 4.12.)</FONT>
