Add another level of cache. That makes the calculation much more complicated, of course. Apart from the complication of yet another subsystem, the miss rate in an L2 cache is often depressingly high; the L1 cache has already &#8220;skimmed the cream&#8221;(Thanks to Hennessy and Patterson for this evocative metaphor.) of the repetitive data access behavior of the CPU. To make it worthwhile, the L2 cache must be much larger (typically eight times or greater) than the L1 cache, and an L2 cache hit must be much faster (two times or better) than a memory reference.
