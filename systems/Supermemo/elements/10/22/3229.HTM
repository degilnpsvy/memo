<FONT class=extract>The uncached entry points used when SR(BEV) is set are fixed, but when SR(BEV) is clear, the EBase register can be programmed to shift all the entry points&#8212; together&#8212;to some other block.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>It&#8217;s particularly useful to be able to move the interrupt base when your CPU is part of a multiprocessor system sharing the kseg0 memory but wants to have separate exception entry points from the other CPUs in the system.&#65288;The EBase register was introduced in Release 2 of the MIPS32/64 specification.&#65289;</FONT>
