The MIPS exception mechanism is general purpose, but democratically speaking there are two exception types that happen far more often than all the rest put together. One is <FONT class=clozed>the TLB miss when an application running under a memory-mapped OS like UNIX steps outside the (limited) boundaries of the on-chip translation table</FONT>; we mentioned that before and will come back to it in Chapter 6. The other popular exceptions are <FONT class=clozed>interrupts, occurring when a device outside the CPU wants attention. Since we&#8217;re dealing with an outside world that won&#8217;t wait for us, interrupt service time is often critical</FONT>.
