Not only are interrupt handlers run with the IPL set to the level appropriate to their particular interrupt cause, but there&#8217;s provision for programmers to raise and lower the IPL. Those parts of the application side of a device driver that communicate with the hardware or the interrupt handler will often need to prevent device interrupts in their critical regions, so the programmer will temporarily raise the IPL to match that of the device&#8217;s interrupt input. In such a system, high-IPL interrupts can continue to be enabled without affecting the lower-IPL code, so we&#8217;ve got the chance to offer better interrupt response time to some interrupts, usually in exchange for a promise that their interrupt handlers will run to completion in a short time.
