The first operation is called write-back. When the data of interest is present in the cache and is dirty (marked as having been written by the CPU since it was last obtained from memory or written back to memory), then the CPU copies the data from the cache into main memory. </P>
<P>The second is invalidate. When the data of interest is in the cache, the CPU marks it invalid so that any subsequent access will fetch fresh data from memory.
