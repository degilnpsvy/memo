Physical addresses higher than <FONT class=clozed>512MB</FONT> are not accessible here: A 64-bit CPU will have direct access through another window, or you can set up the TLB (memory management/translation hardware) to map an address. Each TLB entry can be marked to make accesses either <FONT class=clozed>cached or uncached</FONT>.</SPAN>
