Each atomic chunk of code has the following structure:( 13. Dijkstra formulated these ideas back in the 1970s and named it a &#8220;semaphore&#8221; from a railway signaling analogy. Hoare set them in the wider context of &#8220;cooperating parallel processes&#8221; and called essentially the same functions wait() and signal()&#8212;and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve used. Dijkstra&#8217;s original names are p() and v(), respectively. You can understand why he called them &#8220;p&#8221; and &#8220;v&#8221; quite easily, if you speak Dutch. )
