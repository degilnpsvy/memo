Each entry in the table has the virtual address of a page (the <FONT class=extract>VPN for virtual page number</FONT>), and a physical page address (<FONT class=extract>PFN for page frame numbe<FONT class=clozed>r</FONT></FONT>). When a program presents a virtual address, it is compared with each VPN in the TLB, and if it matches an entry the corresponding PFN is delivered.
