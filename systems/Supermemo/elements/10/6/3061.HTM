You can send function definitions to the Lisp subprocess by putting the cursor anywhere within a function's definition and using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-M-x</SPAN>, which in this case stands for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>lisp-send-defun</SPAN>. This procedure causes the functions you define to become known to the Lisp interpreter so that you can invoke them later.
