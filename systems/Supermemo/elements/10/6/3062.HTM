<P class=docText>The first of these <A name=gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2628></A>is the command <FONT class=extract><SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-</SPAN>: (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>eval-expression</SPAN>).</FONT> This command enables you to type a one-line Lisp expression of any kind in the minibuffer; the expression is evaluated, and the result is printed in the minibuffer. This is an excellent, quick way to check the values of Emacs variables and to experiment with "internal" Emacs functions that aren't bound to keys or that require arguments. You can use the symbol completion command <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-Tab</SPAN> while you are using <SPAN class=docEmphBold>eval-expression</SPAN>.
