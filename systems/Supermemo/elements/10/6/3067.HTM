Any C compiler that complies with the MIPS/SGI rules aligns eight-byte long double-precision floating-point variables to <FONT class=clozed>eight-byte </FONT>boundaries. The 32-bit hardware does not require this alignment, but it&#8217;s done for forward compatibility: 64-bit CPUs will trap if asked to load a double from a location that is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
