Any C compiler that complies with the MIPS/SGI rules aligns eight-byte long double-precision floating-point variables to <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>boundaries. The 32-bit hardware does not require this alignment, but it&#8217;s done for forward compatibility: <FONT class=extract>64-bit CPUs will trap if asked to load a double from a location that is not eight-byte aligned.</FONT>
