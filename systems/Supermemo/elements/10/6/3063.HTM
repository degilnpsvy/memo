<P class=docText>Another feature that helps you exercise Emacs Lisp code is <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-e</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>eval-last-sexp</SPAN>). This command runs the line of Lisp that your cursor is on and prints its value in the minibuffer. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x C-e</SPAN> is handy for testing single lines of code in an Emacs Lisp file.
