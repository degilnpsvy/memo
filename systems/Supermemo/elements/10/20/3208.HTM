As in the previous example, you can jump back and forth between an unlimited number of buffers while defining a macro. Macros don't need to be confined to one buffer. Macros that work with several buffers are more difficult to debug; when several buffers are involved, it becomes harder for you to keep track of where the cursor and the mark are. It is also easy to make mistaken assumptions about what buffer you're visiting; hence, it's a good idea to<FONT class=clozed> specify the buffer name explicitly</FONT>. However, after you get accustomed to working with macros and multiple buffers, you'll be amazed at how much work you can do with almost no effort.
