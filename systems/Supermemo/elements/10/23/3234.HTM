<P>RE </P>
<P>(reverse endianness in user mode): The MIPS processors can be configured, at reset time, with either endianness (see section 10.2 if you don&#8217;t know what that means). Since human beings are perverse, there are now two universes of MIPS implementation: DEC and Windows NT led off with little-endian, while SGI and their UNIX world was big-endian. Embedded applications originally showed a strong big-endian bias but are now thoroughly mixed. </P>
<P>It could be a useful feature in an operating system to be able to run software from the opposite universe; the RE bit makes it possible. When RE is active, user-privilege software runs as if the CPU had been configured with the opposite endianness. </P>
<P>However, achieving cross-universe running would require a large software effort as well, and to date nobody has done it.</P></BODY>
