Here&#8217;s what a MIPS CPU does when it decides to take an exception: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>1. It sets up EPC to point to the restart location. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>2. It sets SR(EXL),which forces the CPU into kernel (high-privilege) mode and disables interrupts. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>3. Cause is set up so that software can see the reason for the exception. On address exceptions, BadVAddr is also set. Memory management system exceptions set up some of the MMU registers too; more details are given in Chapter 6. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>4. The CPU then starts fetching instructions from the exception entry point, and everything else is up to software.</FONT>
