In Emacs Lisp mode, the command <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-M-x</SPAN> (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>eval-defun</SPAN>) picks up the function definition around or after the cursor and evaluates it, meaning that it parses the function and stores it so that Emacs "knows" about the function when you invoke it.
