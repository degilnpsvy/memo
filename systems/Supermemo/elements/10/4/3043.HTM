DRAM memory systems have to do a lot of work to start up, then tend to provide data quite fast. The closer the memory is to the CPU and the shorter the data path between them, the sooner the data will arrive. Increasing bandwidth costs money. Decreasing latency, on the other hand, is usually achieved by simplifying the system: So this is the only point in this list where you can save money and gain performance at the same time.

CPU designers are loath to deal with system issues when they decide the interface of their chips, perhaps because their job is too complicated already!</SPAN>

However, while memory latency has reduced only very slowly as the chips shrink, the bandwidth available from a single standard memory component has exploded. And within a DRAM bank, chips expose separate internal banks where accesses can be pipelined to reduce overall latency. As a result, physical bank interleaving is now rare.</SPAN>
