The synci instruction (new to the MIPS32 Release 2 update) provides a clean mechanism for ensuring that instructions you&#8217;ve just written are correctly presented for execution (it combines a D-cache write-back with an I-cache invalidate). If your CPU supports it, you should use synci in preference to the traditional alternative (a pair of cache instructions, to do D-cache write-back followed by an I-cache invalidate).
