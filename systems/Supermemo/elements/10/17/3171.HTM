To manage the caches, there are a number of primitive operations we&#8217;d really like. The actions we need to achieve are: 
<P></P>
<P>*Invalidate range of locations: </P>
<P>Removes any data from this address range from the cache, so that the next reference to it will acquire fresh data from memory. </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The instruction cache HitInvalidate has the form of a load/store instruction, providing a virtual address. It invalidates any single cache line containing the data referenced by that virtual address. Repeat the instruction at line-size-separated addresses across the range.</FONT> </P>
<P>*Write-back range of locations: </P>
<P>Ensures that any CPU-written data in this range currently held in dirty cache lines is sent back to main memory. </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The instruction cache HitWritebackInvalidate writes back any single cache line containing the data referenced by that virtual address, and then makes it invalid as a bonus. </FONT></P>
<P>*Invalidate entire cache: </P>
<P>Discards all cached data. This is rarely required except at initialization, but is sometimes the last resort of operating system code that is not sure which cached data needs to be invalidated. </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The instruction cache IndexInvalidate is used here. Its address argument is interpreted only as an index into the memory array underlying the cache&#8212;successive lines are accessed at index values from 0 upward, in cache-line-size increments. </FONT></P>
<P>*<FONT class=extract>Initialize caches: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Whatever is required to get the caches usable from an unknown state. Setting up the cache control fields (the &#8220;tag&#8221;) usually involves zeroing the CP0 TagLo register and using a cache Index- StoreTag operation on each line-sized chunk of the cache. Caches with data check bits may also need to be prefilled with data&#8212;even though the lines are invalid, they should not have bad check bits. Prefilling an I-cache would be tricky, but you can usually use a cache Fill instruction.</FONT>
