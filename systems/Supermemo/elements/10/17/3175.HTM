Initialize caches: </P>
<P>Whatever is required to get the caches usable from an unknown state. Setting up the cache control fields (the &#8220;tag&#8221;) usually involves zeroing the CP0 TagLo register and using a cache Index- StoreTag operation on each line-sized chunk of the cache. Caches with data check bits may also need to be prefilled with data&#8212;even though the lines are invalid, they should not have bad check bits. Prefilling an I-cache would be tricky, but you can usually use a cache Fill instruction.
