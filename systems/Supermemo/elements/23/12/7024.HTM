Earlier, in &#8220;Referring to Remote Repositories&#8221; on page 200, you were cautioned about using the remote repository URL form /path/to/repo.git because it might exhibit problems characteristic of repositories that use shared files. On the other hand, setting up a common depot containing several similar repositories is a common situation where you would want to use a shared, underlying object store. In this case, you expect the repositories to be monotonically increasing in size without objects and refs being removed from them. This situation can benefit from large-scale sharing of the object store by many repositories, thus saving tremendous volumes of disk space. To achieve this space savings, consider using the --reference repository, the --local, or the --shared options during the initial bare repository clone setup step for your published repositories.
