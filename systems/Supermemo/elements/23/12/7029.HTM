A tag and a branch serve different purposes. A tag is meant to be a static name that does not change or move over time. Once applied, you should leave it alone. It serves as <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>in the ground and reference point. On the other hand, a branch is dynamic and moves with each commit you make. The branch name is designed to follow your continuing development.
