The more complicated situations arise when you have private code that you want to keep in house and therefore must set up and maintain your own master depot for repository hosting. Oh, and don&#8217;t forget your own backups! 
<P></P>
<P>In this case, the usual approach is to use the Git-over-SSH protocol and require all users of the repository to have SSH access to the hosting server. On the server itself, a semigeneric user account and group (e.g., git or gituser) are usually created. All repositories are group owned by this user and typically live in some filespace (e.g., /git, /opt/git, or /var/git) set aside for this purpose. Here&#8217;s the key: that directory must be owned by your git user group, be writable by that group, and it must have the sticky group bit set.
