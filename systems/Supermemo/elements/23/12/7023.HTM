The phrase &#8220;commit rights&#8221; is really sort of a <FONT class=extract>misnomer</FONT> in Git. Git doesn&#8217;t try to manage access rights, leaving that issue to other tools, such as SSH, which are more suited to the task. You can always commit in any repository to which you have (Unix) access, either via SSH and coding to that repository, or to which you have direct rwx-mode access. The concept might better be paraphrased as &#8220;Can I update the published repository?&#8221; In that expression, you can see the issue is really the question, &#8220;Can I push changes to the published repository?&#8221;
