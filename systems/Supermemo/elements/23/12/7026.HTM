Now, when you want to create a new, hosted repository called newrepo.git on your server, just ssh into the server and do this:</P>
<P>$ ssh git.my-host.example.com </P>
<P>$ cd /git </P>
<P>$ mkdir newrepo.git </P>
<P>$ cd newrepo.git </P>
<P>$ git init --shared --bare </P>
<P>Those last four commands can be simplified as follows: </P>
<P>$ git --git-dir /git/newrepo.git init --shared</P>
<P>At this point, the bare repository structure exists, but it remains empty. The important aspect of this repository, though, is that it is now receptive to a push of initial content from any user authorized to connect with the server. </P>
<P># from some client </P>
<P>$ cd /path/to/existing/initial/repo.git </P>
<P>$ git push git+ssh://git.my-host.example.com/git/newrepo.git master</P>
<P>The whole process of executing that git init on the server in such a way that subsequent pushes will work is at the heart of the Git web hosting services. That command is essentially what happens when you click on the GitHub &#8220;New Repo&#8221; button.
