What if you don&#8217;t specify a refspec at all on a git push command? How does Git know what to do or where to send data? 
<P></P>
<P>First, without an explicit remote given to the command, Git assumes <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. Without a refspec, git push will send your commits to the remote for all branches that are common between your repository and the upstream repository. Any local branch that is not already present in the upstream repository will not be sent upstream; branches must already exist and match names. Thus, new branches must be explicitly pushed by name. Later they can be defaulted with a simple git push. Thus, the default refspec makes the following two commands equivalent:</P>
<P>$ git push origin branch </P>
<P>$ git push origin branch:refs/heads/branch
