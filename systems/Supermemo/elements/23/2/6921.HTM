By default, each new clone maintains a link back to its parent repository via a remote called origin.

<P>The name &#8220;origin&#8221; isn&#8217;t special in any way. If you don&#8217;t want to use it, simply specify an alternate with the<FONT class=clozed> --origin name</FONT> option during the clone operation.
