To rename a remote and all of its refs, use git remote rename old new. After this command: 
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>any ref like jon/bugfixes will be renamed as jdl/bugfixes. </P>
<P>In addition to manipulations of the remote name and its refs, you can also update or change the URL of the remote: </P>
<P>$ git remote set-url origin git://repos.example.com/stuff.git
