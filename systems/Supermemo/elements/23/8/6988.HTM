The software run in MIPS exception mode can be seen as producing <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>that looks after saving the interrupted user program&#8217;s state immediately after an exception and then restores it while preparing for the eret, which will take us back again. Programmers need to be very careful what they do in exception mode. Exceptions are largely beyond the control of the software locks that make the kernel thread-safe, so exception code may only interact very carefully with the rest of the kernel.
