You may recall from &#8220;refs and symrefs&#8221; on page 68 of Chapter 6 that a local topic branch that you call dev is really named <FONT class=clozed>refs/heads/dev</FONT>. Similarly, remote-tracking branches are retained in the <FONT class=clozed>refs/remotes/</FONT> namespace. Thus, the remote-tracking branch origin/master is actually <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
