MIPS is a RISC: a useful acronym, well applied to the common features of a number of computer architectures invented in the 1980s, to realize efficient pipelined implementation. The acronym CISC is vaguer. I&#8217;ll use it in a narrow sense, for the kind of features found in x86 and other pre-1982 architectures, designed with microcoded implementations in mind.</FONT></SPAN>
