When Org mode prompts for a date/time&#65306;</P>
<P>Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the first thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter ([hdwmy]) to indicate change in hours, days, weeks, months, or years. With a single plus or minus, the date is always relative to today. With a double plus or minus, it is relative to the default date. If instead of a single letter, you use the abbreviation of day name, the date will be the Nth such day, e.g.: </P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>+0</FONT> ? today </P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>.</FONT> ? today </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> ? four days from today </P>
<P>+4 ? same as above </P>
<P>+2w ? two weeks from today </P>
<P>++5 ? five days from default date </P>
<P>+2tue ? second Tuesday from now </P>
<P>-wed ? last Wednesday
