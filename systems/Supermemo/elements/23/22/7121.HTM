<FONT class=extract>So long as the CPU runs from the cache, the execution of every MIPS instruction is divided into five phases, called pipe stages, with each pipestage taking a fixed amount of time. The fixed amount of time is usually a processor clock cycle (though some actions take only half a clock, so the MIPS five-stage pipeline actually occupies only four clock cycles).</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>All instructions are rigidly defined so they can follow the same sequence of pipe stages, even where the instruction does nothing at some stage. The net result is that, so long as it keeps hitting the cache, the CPU starts an instruction every clock cycle
