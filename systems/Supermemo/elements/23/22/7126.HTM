MIPS CPUs in use today come in four broad categories: </P>
<P>SoC cores: MIPS CPUs still benefit in size and power consumption from the simplicity that came from the Stanford project, and an architecture with a long history spanning handhelds to supercomputers is an attractive alternative to architectures tailored for the low end. MIPS was the first &#8220;grown up&#8221; CPU to be available as an ASIC core&#8212;witness its presence in the Sony PlayStation games console. The most prominent supplier is MIPS Technologies Inc., but Philips retains their own designs. </P>
<P>Integrated embedded 32-bit CPUs: From a few dollars upward, these chips contain CPU, caches, and substantial application-oriented blocks (network controllers are popular). There&#8217;s considerable variation in price, power consumption, and processing power. Although AMD/Alchemy has some very attractive products, this market seems to be doomed, with devices in the target marketplace finding that an SoC heart does a better job of maximizing integration, saving vital dollars and milliwatts. </P>
<P>Integrated embedded 64-bit CPUs: These chips offer a very attractive speed/power-consumption trade-off for high-end embedded applications: Network routers and laser printers are common applications. But it doesn&#8217;t look as though they can sell in sufficient numbers to go on paying for chip development costs. </P>
<P>But somewhere in this category are companies that are trying radically new ideas, and it&#8217;s a tribute to the MIPS architecture&#8217;s clean concepts that it often seems the best base for leading-edge exploration. Raza&#8217;s XLR series of multicore, multithreaded processors represent a different kind of embedded CPU, which aims to add more value (and capture more revenue per unit) than a &#8220;traditional&#8221; embedded CPU. Cavium&#8217;s Octium is also pretty exciting. </P>
<P>Server processors: Silicon Graphics, the workstation company that was the adoptive parent of the MIPS architecture, continued to ship high end MIPS systems right up to its insolvency in 2006, even though that was seven years after it committed to a future with Intel IA-64. But it&#8217;s the end of the road for these systems: MIPS is destined to be &#8220;only&#8221; in the vast consumer and embedded markets.
