<FONT class=extract>IF (instruction fetch) Gets the next instruction from the instruction cache (I-cache).</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>RD (read registers) Fetches the contents of the CPU registers whose numbers are in the two possible source register fields of the instruction.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ALU (arithmetic/logic unit) Performs an arithmetical or logical operation in one clock cycle (floating-point math and integer multiply/divide can&#8217;t be done in one clock cycle and are done differently, but that comes later).</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>MEM Is the stage where the instruction can read/write memory variables in the data cache (D-cache). On average, about three out of four instructions do nothing in this stage, but allocating the stage for each instruction ensures that you never get two instructions wanting the data cache at the same time. (It&#8217;s the same as the mushy peas served by Dionysus.)</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>WB (write back) Stores the value obtained from an operation back to the register file.</FONT>
