The MIPS project architects also attended to the best thinking of the time about what makes a CPU an easy target for efficient optimizing compilers. Many of those requirements are quite compatible with the pipeline requirements, so MIPS CPUs have 32 general-purpose registers and three-operand arithmetical/ logical instructions. Happily, the complicated special-purpose instructions that particularly upset pipelines are often those that compilers are unwilling to generate. </P>
<P>The RISC pioneers&#8217; judgment has stood the test of time. More recent instruction sets have pushed the hardware/software line back even further; they are called VLIW (very long instruction word) and/or EPIC (explicitly parallel instruction computing). The most prominent is Intel&#8217;s IA64 architecture, but it has not succeeded despite massive investment; it appears to have got the hardware/software boundary wrong.
