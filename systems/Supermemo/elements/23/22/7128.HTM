<P>Like most assembly languages, it is line oriented. The end of a line delimits instructions, and the assembly&#8217;s native comment convention is that it ignores any text on a line beyond a &#8220;#&#8221; character. But it is possible to put more than one instruction on a line, separated by semicolons. </P>
<P>A label is a word followed by a colon &#8220;:&#8221;&#8212;word is interpreted loosely, and labels can contain all sorts of strange characters. Labels are used to define entry points in code and to name storage locations in data sections.
