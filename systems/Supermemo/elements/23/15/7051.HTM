Before Git removes a file, it checks to make sure the version of the file <FONT class=clozed>in the working directory matches the latest version in the current branch (the version that Git commands call the HEAD). </FONT>This verification precludes the accidental loss of any changes (due to your editing) that may have been made to the file.
