Git makes use of a special graph called a <FONT class=extract>directed acyclic graph (DAG)</FONT>. A DAG has two important properties. First, the edges within the graph are all directed from one node to another. Second, starting at any node in the graph, there is no path along the directed edges that leads back to the starting node.
