The hard problem is not difficult actions, it&#8217;s awkward customers. Back in the chip shop Cyril is often short of cash, so Evie won&#8217;t serve him until Mary has counted his money. When Cyril arrives, he&#8217;s stuck at Evie&#8217;s position until Mary has finished with the three previous customers and can check his pile of old bent coins. Cyril is trouble, because when he comes in he needs a resource (Mary&#8217;s counting) that is being used by previous customers. He&#8217;s a resource conflict. </P>
<P>Daphne and Lola always come in together (in that order) and share their meals. Lola won&#8217;t have chips unless Daphne gets some tea (too salty without something to drink). Lola waits on tenterhooks in front of Bert until Daphne gets toMary, and so a gap appears in the pipeline. This is a dependency (and the gap is called a pipeline bubble). </P>
<P>Not all dependencies are a problem. Frank always wants exactly the same meal as Fred, but he can follow him down the counter anyway&#8212;if Fred gets chips, Frank gets chips.
