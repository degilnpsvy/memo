An interrupt handler using <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>set can be unburdened by housekeeping and can run phenomenally fast. But again, that advantage can be lost by the discipline of an OS (in particular because the OS is likely to disable all interrupts for periods of time that far exceed our superfast interrupt handler&#8217;s run time). Some applications that would benefit from shadow registers might get the same kind of benefit more cleanly by using a multithreading CPU, but that&#8217;s a much bigger story&#8212;see Appendix A.
