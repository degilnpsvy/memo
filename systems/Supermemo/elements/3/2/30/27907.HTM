* FAULTMASK 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The fault mask, a 1-bit register. Setting FAULTMASK to 1 raises the execution priority to -1, the priority of HardFault. Only privileged software executing at a priority below -1 can set FAULTMASK to 1. This means HardFault and NMI handlers cannot set FAULTMASK to 1. Returning from any exception except NMI clears FAULTMASK to 0.</FONT>
