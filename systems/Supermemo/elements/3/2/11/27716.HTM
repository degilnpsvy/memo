A3.5 Memory types and attributes and the memory order model 
<P></P>
<P><BR>ARMv7 defines a set of memory attributes with the characteristics required to support the memory and devices in the system memory map.<BR>The ordering of accesses for regions of memory, referred to as the memory order model, is defined by the memory attributes. This model is described in the following sections:<BR>&#8226; Memory types<BR>&#8226; Summary of ARMv7 memory attributes on page A3-100<BR>&#8226; Atomicity in the ARM architecture on page A3-101<BR>&#8226; Normal memory on page A3-102<BR>&#8226; Device memory on page A3-105<BR>&#8226; Strongly-ordered memory on page A3-106<BR>&#8226; Memory access restrictions on page A3-107
