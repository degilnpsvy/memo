A3.5.4 Normal memory 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Normal memory is idempotent, meaning that it exhibits the following properties:<BR>&#8226; read accesses can be repeated with no side effects<BR>&#8226; repeated read accesses return the last value written to the resource being read<BR>&#8226; read accesses can prefetch additional memory locations with no side effects<BR>&#8226; write accesses can be repeated with no side effects, provided that the contents of the location are unchanged between the repeated writes<BR>&#8226; unaligned accesses can be supported<BR>&#8226; accesses can be merged before accessing the target memory system.</FONT></P>
<P>Normal memory can be read/write or read-only, and a Normal memory region is defined as being either Shareable or Non-shareable.</P>
<P>The Normal memory type attribute applies to most memory used in a system.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Accesses to Normal memory have a weakly consistent model of memory ordering. See a standard text describing memory ordering issues for a description of weakly consistent memory models, for example chapter 2 of Memory Consistency Models for Shared Memory-Multiprocessors, Kourosh Gharachorloo, Stanford University Technical Report CSL-TR-95-685. In general, for Normal memory, barrier operations are required where the order of memory accesses observed by other observers must be controlled. This requirement applies regardless of the cacheability and shareability attributes of the Normal memory region.</FONT></P>
<P>The ordering requirements of accesses described in Ordering requirements for memory accesses on page A3-114 apply to all explicit accesses.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>An instruction that generates a sequence of accesses as described in Atomicity in the ARM architecture on page A3-101 might be abandoned as a result of an exception being taken during the sequence of accesses. On return from the exception the instruction is restarted, and therefore one or more of the memory locations might be accessed multiple times. This can result in repeated write accesses to a location that has been changed between the write accesses.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Note<BR>For ARMv7-M, the LDM, STM, PUSH, POP, VLDM, VSTM, VPUSH and VPOP instructions can restart or continue on exception return, see Exceptions in Load Multiple and Store Multiple operations on page B1-658.</FONT>
