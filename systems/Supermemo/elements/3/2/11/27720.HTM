Non-shareable Normal memory 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>For a Normal memory region, the Non-shareable attribute identifies Normal memory that is likely to be accessed only by a single processor.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A region of memory marked as Non-shareable Normal does not have any requirement to make the effect of a cache transparent for data or instruction accesses. If other observers share the memory system, software must use cache maintenance operations if the presence of caches might lead to coherency issues when communicating between the observers. This cache maintenance requirement is in addition to the barrier operations that are required to ensure memory ordering.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>For Non-shareable Normal memory, the Load Exclusive and Store Exclusive synchronization primitives do not take account of the possibility of accesses by more than one observer.</FONT>
