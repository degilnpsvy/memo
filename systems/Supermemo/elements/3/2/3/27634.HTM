The manual has the following parts: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Part A<BR>The application level programming model and memory model information along with the instruction set as visible to the application programmer.<BR>This is the information required to program applications or to develop the toolchain components (compiler, linker, assembler and disassembler) excluding the debugger. For ARMv7-M, this is almost entirely a subset of material common to the other two profiles. Instruction set details that differ between profiles are clearly stated.<BR>Note<BR>All ARMv7 profiles support a common procedure calling standard, the ARM Architecture Procedure Calling Standard (AAPCS).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Part B<BR>The system level programming model and system level support instructions required for system correctness. The system level supports the ARMv7-M exception model. It also provides features for configuration and control of processor resources and management of memory access rights.<BR>This is the information in addition to Part A required for an operating system (OS) and/or system support software. It includes details of register banking, the exception model, memory protection (management of access rights) and cache support.<BR>Part B is profile specific. ARMv7-M introduces a new programmers&#8217; model and as such has some fundamental differences at the system level from the other profiles. As ARMv7-M is a memory-mapped architecture, the system memory map is documented here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Part C<BR>The debug features to support the ARMv7-M debug architecture and the programming interface to the debug environment.<BR>This is the information required in addition to Parts A and B to write a debugger. Part C covers details of the different types of debug:<BR>&#8226; halting debug and the related Debug state<BR>&#8226; exception-based monitor debug<BR>&#8226; non-invasive support for event generation and signalling of the events to an external agent.<BR>This part is profile specific and includes several debug features that are supported only in the ARMv7-M architecture profile.</FONT></P>
<P>Appendices<BR>The appendices give information that relates to, but is not part of, the ARMv7-M architecture profile specification.
