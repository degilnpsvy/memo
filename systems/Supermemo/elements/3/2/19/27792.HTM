<P>Coprocessor power control register, address 0xE000E00C, reset to 0.</P>
<P>SUn Each SUn bit corresponds to one of the coprocessors, and is enumerated as follows<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 The state associated with coprocessor n is not permitted to become UNKNOWN.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 The state associated with coprocessor n is permitted to become UNKNOWN. This can be used as a hint to power control logic that the coprocessor may be powered down. Accesses to the coprocessor will generate a NOCP UsageFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Setting this bit to 1 does not guarantee that the state in the coprocessor is erased.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: The value of SU11 is ignored. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the SU10 field, then the value is UNKNOWN<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUn bits corresponding to coprocessors that don't have power domains or aren't implemented behave as RAZ/WI.</P>
<P>SUSn Each SUSn bit corresponds to one of the coprocessors, and is enumerated as follows<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 The SUn bit is accessible from the non-secure state. NOCP UsageFaults that result from accessing coprocessor n while SUn is 1 target the current security state.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 The SUn bit behaves as RAZ/WI from the non-secure state. NOCP UsageFaults that result from accessing coprocessor n while SUn is 1 target the secure state.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: The value of SUS11 is ignored. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the SUS10 field, then the value is UNKNOWN<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUSn bits corresponding to coprocessors that don't have power domains or aren't implemented behave as RAZ/WI.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These fields behave as RAZ/WI when accesses from the non-secure state.</P>
<P>This register is only accessible from a privileged state, accesses from unprivileged states generate a BusFault.
