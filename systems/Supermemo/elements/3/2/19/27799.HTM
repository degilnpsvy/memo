6.13 SecureFault 
<P></P>
<P>A new SecureFault exception is defined with an exception number of 7. This exception is triggered by the various security checks that are performed (e.g. when jumping from non-secure code to an address in secure code that isn't marked as a valid entry point). Full details of all the cases that can generate this exception can be seen in the pseudo code through this specification. It is expected that most systems will choose to treat a SecureFault as a terminal condition that either halts or restarts the system. Any other handing of the SecureFault must be checked carefully to make sure it does not inadvertently introduce a security vulnerability.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The priority of SecureFault can be configured using the PRI_7 field in the SHPR1 register. As such this field is defined RAZ/WI when accessed from the non-secure state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SecureFaults always target the secure state, and as such exception number 7 in the non-secure vector table (see section 6.11) is reserved.</FONT>
