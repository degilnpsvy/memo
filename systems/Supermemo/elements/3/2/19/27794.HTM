4.8.6 CPACR</P>
<P>The existing CPACR register is banked between the non-secure and secure states. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED co-processors (I.E. coprocessors 0-7) can be used from both security state, or whether they are hardwired to only be enabled for a single state. If a co-processor is hard wired to a single security state the CPACR.CPn fields for the other state should behave as RAZ/WI.</P>
<P>The existing UNPREDICTABLE behaviour if CP10 and CP11 have different values is changed such that: The FPU permitted access check is based on the value of CP10. The value of CP11 is ignored. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the CP10 field, then the value is UNKNOWN.
