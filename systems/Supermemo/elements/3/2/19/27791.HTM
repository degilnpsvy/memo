<P>Non-Secure Access Control Register, address 0xE000ED8C, Resets to UNKNOWN.</P>
<P>CPn Each CPn bit corresponds to one of the coprocessors, and is enumerated as follows<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 Otherwise valid accesses to the coprocessor from the non-secure state result in a NOCP UsageFault being raised that targets the secure state.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Access to the coprocessor is allowed from any security state.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: The value of CP11 is ignored. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the CP10 field, then the value is UNKNOWN<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPn bits corresponding to coprocessors that aren't implemented behave as RAZ/WI.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPn bits corresponding to coprocessors that are hard wired to only be enabled for a single security domain behave as RAZ/WI.</P>
<P>This register is only accessible from the secure privileged state, accesses from unprivileged states generate a BusFault and access from the privileged non-secure state behave as RAZ/WI.
