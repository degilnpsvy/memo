Execute Never encoding</P>
<P>The XN bit provides an Execute Never capability. For the processor to execute an instruction, the instruction must be in a memory region with:<BR>&#8226; read access, indicated by the AP bits, for the appropriate privilege level<BR>&#8226; the XN bit set to 0.</P>
<P>Otherwise, the processor generates a MemManage fault when it issues the instruction for execution. Therefore, Table B3-54 shows the encoding of the XN bit:</P>
<P>Table B3-54 Execute Never encoding<BR>XN&nbsp;&nbsp; Description<BR>0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execution of an instruction fetched from this region permitted<BR>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Execution of an instruction fetched from this region not permitted
