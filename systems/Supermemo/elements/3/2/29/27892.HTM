Memory region subregions</P>
<P>For any region of 256 bytes or larger, the MPU divides the region into eight equally-sized subregions. Setting a bit in the SRD field to 1 disables the corresponding subregion:<BR>&#8226; The least significant bit of the field, MPU_RASR[8], controls the subregion with the lowest address range.<BR>&#8226; The most significant bit of the field, MPU_RASR[15], controls the subregion with the highest address range.</P>
<P>For region sizes of 32, 64, and 128 bytes, the effect of setting one or more bits of the SRD field to 1 is UNPREDICTABLE.</P>
<P>See Sub-region support on page B3-762 for more information.
