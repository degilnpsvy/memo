An ARMv7-M processor implements the following special-purpose registers for exception priority boosting:<BR><FONT class=clozed><FONT class=extract>* PRIMASK The exception mask register, a 1-bit register. Setting PRIMASK to 1 raises the execution priority to 0.</FONT><BR><FONT class=extract>* BASEPRI The base priority mask, an 8-bit register. BASEPRI changes the priority level required for exception preemption. It has an effect only when BASEPRI has a lower value than the unmasked priority level of the currently executing software.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of implemented bits in BASEPRI is the same as the number of implemented bits in each field of the priority registers, and BASEPRI has the same format as those fields. For more information see Maximum supported priority value on page B1-636.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A value of zero disables masking by BASEPRI.</FONT><BR><FONT class=extract>* FAULTMASK The fault mask, a 1-bit register. Setting FAULTMASK to 1 raises the execution priority to -1, the priority of HardFault. Only privileged software executing at a priority below -1 can set FAULTMASK to 1. This means HardFault and NMI handlers cannot set FAULTMASK to 1. Returning from any exception except NMI clears FAULTMASK to 0.</FONT></FONT>
