B3.5.8 MPU alias register support</P>
<P>The MPU_RBAR and MPU_RSAR form a pair of words in the address range 0xE000ED9C-0xE000EDA3. An ARMv7-M processor implements aliases of this address range at offsets of +8 bytes, +16 bytes, and +24 bytes from the MPU_RBAR address of 0xE000ED9C, as Table B3-44 on page B3-765 shows. Using these register aliases with the MPU_RBAR.REGION field, and the MPU.RBAR.VALID field set to 1, software can use a stream of word writes to update efficiently up to four regions, provided all the regions accessed are in the range region 0 to region 15.
