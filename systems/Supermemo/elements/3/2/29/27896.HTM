When the MPU is disabled or not present, the system adopts the default system memory map listed in Table B3-1 on page B3-705. 
<P></P>
<P>When the MPU is enabled, the enabled regions define the system address map with the following provisos:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>accesses to the Private Peripheral Bus (PPB) always uses the default system address map</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>exception vector reads from the Vector Address Table always use the default system address map</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>the MPU is restricted in how it can change the default memory map attributes associated with System space (address 0xE0000000 or higher).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System space is always marked as XN, Execute Never.</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>When the execution priority is less than 0, MPU_CTRL.HFNMIENA determines whether memory accesses use the MPU or the default memory map attributes. The execution priority is less than 0 if the processor is executing the NMI or HardFault handler, or if FAULTMASK is set to 1.</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>the default system memory map can be configured to provide a background region for privileged accesses</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>accesses with an address match in more than one region use the highest matching region number for the access attributes</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8213; <FONT class=extract>accesses that do not match all access conditions of a region address match (with the MPU enabled) or a background/default memory map match generate a fault.</FONT>
