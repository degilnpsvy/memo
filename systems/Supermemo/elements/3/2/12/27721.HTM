Shareable Normal memory 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>For Normal memory, the Shareable memory attribute describes Normal memory that is expected to be accessed by multiple processors or other system masters.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A region of Normal memory with the Sharable attribute is one for which the effect of interposing a cache, or caches, on the memory system is entirely transparent to data accesses in the same shareability domain. Explicit software management is needed to ensure the coherency of instruction caches.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Implementations can use a variety of mechanisms to support this management requirement, from simply not caching accesses in Shareable regions to more complex hardware schemes for cache coherency for those regions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>For Shareable Normal memory, the Load-Exclusive and Store-Exclusive synchronization primitives take account of the possibility of accesses by more than one observer in the same Shareability domain.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Note<BR>The Shareable concept enables system designers to specify the locations in Normal memory that must have coherency requirements. However, to facilitate porting of software, software developers must not assume that specifying a memory region as Non-shareable permits software to make assumptions about the incoherency of memory locations between different processors in a shared memory system. Such assumptions are not portable between different multiprocessing implementations that make use of the Shareable concept. Any multiprocessing implementation might implement caches that, inherently, are shared between different processing elements.</FONT>
