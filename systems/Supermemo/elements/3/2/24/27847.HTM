There&#8217;s a subvariant of write-back here: If the addressed data is not currently in the cache, we can either write it to main memory and ignore the cache, or we can bring the data in specially just so we can write it&#8212;this is called write-allocate. Write allocate is not always the best approach: Data that is being written for some I/O device to read (and that the CPU will not read or write again) is ideally kept out of the cache. But that only works if the programmers can be relied upon to tell the operating system.
