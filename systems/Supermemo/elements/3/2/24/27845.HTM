B1.4.7 Register-related definitions for pseudocode</P>
<P>The system programmers&#8217; model pseudocode uses two register types:<BR>&#8226; 32-bit core registers, see The ARM core registers on page B1-623<BR>&#8226; 32-bit memory mapped registers.<BR>Appendix H Register Index lists the ARMv7-M registers.</P>
<P>This manual describes register fields as &lt;register_name&gt;.&lt;field_name&gt;, or by a specific bit reference, for example:<BR>&#8226; AIRCR&lt;10:8&gt; is equivalent to AIRCR.PRIGROUP<BR>&#8226; CONTROL&lt;1&gt; is equivalent to CONTROL.SPSEL.</P>
<P>Normally, this manual uses the field names.
