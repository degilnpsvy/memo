UNK/SBOP 
<P></P>
<P>UNKNOWN on reads, Should-Be-One-or-Preserved on writes. </P>
<P>In any implementation, the bit must read as 1, or all 1s for a bit field, and writes to the field must be ignored. Software must not rely on the field reading as 1, or all 1s for a bit field, and must use an SBOP policy to write to the field.</FONT>
