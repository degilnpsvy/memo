In the PPB address space, the architecture assigns a 4KB block, 0xE000E000 to 0xE000EFFF, as the System Control Space (SCS). The SCS supports:<BR>&#8226; processor ID registers<BR>&#8226; general control and configuration, including the vector table base address<BR>&#8226; system handler support, for system interrupts and exceptions<BR>&#8226; a system timer, SysTick<BR>&#8226; a Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), that supports up to 496 discrete external interrupts<BR>&#8226; fault status and control registers<BR>&#8226; the Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7<BR>&#8226; processor debug.
