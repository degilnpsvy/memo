The ARM architecture defines a hierarchy for software operation:<BR>&#8226; The lowest level is the application level, described in part A of this manual. In particular, Chapter A2 Application Level Programmers&#8217; Model describes the programmers model for applications. Application-level software is largely independent of the architecture profile.<BR>&#8226; The higher level is the system level, that includes support for the applications. The system level features and how they are supported, is significantly different in the different ARMv7 architecture profiles.
