B1.2 About the ARMv7-M memory mapped architecture 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ARMv7-M is a memory-mapped architecture, meaning the architecture assigns physical addresses for processor registers to provide:<BR>&#8226; event entry points, as vectors<BR>&#8226; system control and configuration.</FONT></P>
<P>An ARMv7-M implementation maintains exception handler entry points in a table of address pointers.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The architecture reserves address space 0xE0000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF for system-level use. ARM reserves the first 1MB of this system address space, 0xE0000000 to 0xE00FFFFF, as the Private Peripheral Bus (PPB).The assignment of the rest of the address space, from 0xE0100000, is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED, with some memory attribute restrictions. See The system address map on page B3-704 for more information.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>In the PPB address space, the architecture assigns a 4KB block, 0xE000E000 to 0xE000EFFF, as the System Control Space (SCS). The SCS supports:<BR>&#8226; processor ID registers<BR>&#8226; general control and configuration, including the vector table base address<BR>&#8226; system handler support, for system interrupts and exceptions<BR>&#8226; a system timer, SysTick<BR>&#8226; a Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), that supports up to 496 discrete external interrupts<BR>&#8226; fault status and control registers<BR>&#8226; the Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7<BR>&#8226; processor debug.</FONT></P>
<P>See System Control Space (SCS) on page B3-708 for more details.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>In the ARMv7-M architecture, all exceptions and interrupts, including the external interrupts handled by the NVIC, share a common prioritization model, controlled by registers in the SCS.</FONT>
