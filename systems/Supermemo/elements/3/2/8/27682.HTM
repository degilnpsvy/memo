Multi-copy atomicity 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>In a multiprocessing system, writes to a memory location are multi-copy atomic if the following conditions are both true:<BR>&#8226; All writes to the same location are serialized, meaning they are observed in the same order by all observers, although some observers might not observe all of the writes.<BR>&#8226; A read of a location does not return the value of a write until all observers observe that write.</FONT><BR><FONT class=extract>Writes to Normal memory are not multi-copy atomic.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>All writes to Device and Strongly-Ordered memory that are single-copy atomic are also multi-copy atomic.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>All write accesses to the same location are serialized. Write accesses to Normal memory can be repeated up to the point that another write to the same address is observed.</FONT><BR><FONT class=extract>For Normal memory, serialization of writes does not prohibit the merging of writes.</FONT>
