<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR>Is integer arithmetic in which a result that would be greater than the largest representable number is set to the largest representable number, and a result that would be less than the smallest representable number is set to the smallest representable number. Signed <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> is often used in DSP algorithms. It contrasts with the normal signed integer arithmetic used in ARM processors, in which overflowing results wrap around from +231&#8211;1 to &#8211;231 or vice versa.
