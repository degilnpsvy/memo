UAL describes the syntax for the mnemonic(&#21161;&#35760;&#31526;) and the operands of each instruction. In addition, it assumes that instructions and data items can be given labels. It does not specify the syntax to be used for labels, nor what assembler directives and options are available. See your assembler documentation for these details.
