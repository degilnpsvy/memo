A4.2 Unified Assembler Language 
<P></P>
<P>This document uses the ARM Unified Assembler Language (UAL). This assembly language syntax provides a canonical form for all ARM and Thumb instructions.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>UAL describes the syntax for the mnemonic(&#21161;&#35760;&#31526;) and the operands of each instruction. In addition, it assumes that instructions and data items can be given labels. It does not specify the syntax to be used for labels, nor what assembler directives and options are available. See your assembler documentation for these details.</FONT></P>
<P>Earlier ARM assembly language mnemonics are still supported as synonyms, as described in the instruction details.</P>
<P>Note<BR>Most earlier Thumb assembly language mnemonics are not supported. See Appendix B Legacy Instruction Mnemonics for details.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>UAL includes instruction selection rules that specify which instruction encoding is selected when more than one can provide the required functionality. For example, both 16-bit and 32-bit encodings exist for an ADD R0,R1,R2 instruction. The most common instruction selection rule is that when both a 16-bit encoding and a 32-bit encoding are available, the 16-bit encoding is selected, to optimize code density.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Syntax options exist to override the normal instruction selection rules and ensure that a particular encoding is selected. These are useful when disassembling code, to ensure that subsequent assembly produces the original code, and in some other situations.</FONT>
