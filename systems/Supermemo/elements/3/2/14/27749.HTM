UAL includes instruction selection rules that specify which instruction encoding is selected when more than one can provide the required functionality. For example, both 16-bit and 32-bit encodings exist for an ADD R0,R1,R2 instruction. The most common instruction selection rule is that when both a 16-bit encoding and a 32-bit encoding are available, the 16-bit encoding is selected, to optimize code density.

<P>Syntax options exist to override the normal instruction selection rules and ensure that a particular encoding is selected. These are useful when disassembling code, to ensure that subsequent assembly produces the original code, and in some other situations.
