B1.4 Registers</P>
<P>The ARMv7-M profile has the following registers closely coupled to the processor:<BR>&#8226; General-purpose registers R0-R12.<BR>&#8226; Two stack pointer registers, SP_main and SP_process. These are banked versions of SP, also described as R13.<BR>&#8226; The Link Register, LR, also described as R14.<BR>&#8226; The Program Counter, PC, sometimes described as R15.<BR>&#8226; Status registers for flags, execution state bits, and when handling an exception, the exception number.<BR>&#8226; Mask registers used in managing the prioritization scheme for exceptions and interrupts<BR>&#8226; A control register, CONTROL, that identifies the current stack and Thread mode privilege level.</P>
<P>All other registers described in this specification are memory mapped.</P>
<P>Note<BR>Where this part of this manual gives register access restrictions, these apply to normal execution. Debug restrictions can differ, see General rules applying to debug register access on page C1-816, Debug Core Register Selector Register, DCRSR on page C1-834, and Debug Core Register Data Register, DCRDR on page C1-836.
