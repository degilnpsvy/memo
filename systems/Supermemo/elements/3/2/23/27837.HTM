The APSR</P>
<P>Flag setting instructions modify the APSR flags N, Z, C, V, and Q, and the processor uses these flags to evaluate conditional execution in IT and conditional branch instructions. ARM core registers on page A2-46 describes the flags. The flags are UNKNOWN on reset.</P>
<P>On an implementation that includes the DSP extension, the APSR.GE bits are stacked as part of the xPSR on exception entry, and restored as part of exception return. On entry to an exception handler or following a reset, the values of the APSR.GE bits are UNKNOWN.
