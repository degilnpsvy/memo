The IPSR 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The processor writes to the IPSR on exception entry and exit. Software can use an MRS instruction, to read the IPSR, but the processor ignores writes to the IPSR by an MSR instruction.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The IPSR Exception Number field is defined as follows:<BR>&#8226; in Thread mode, the value is 0<BR>&#8226; in Handler mode, holds the exception number of the currently-executing exception.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>An exception number indicates the currently executing exception and its entry vector, see Exception number definition on page B1-633 and The vector table on page B1-634.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>On reset, the processor is in Thread mode and the Exception Number field of the IPSR is cleared to 0. As a result, the value 1, the exception number for reset, is a transitory value, that software cannot see as a valid IPSR Exception Number.</FONT>
