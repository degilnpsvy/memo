B1.4.2 The special-purpose program status registers, xPSR
<P></P>
<P>The Program Status Register (PSR) is a 32-bit register that comprises three subregisters:<BR>* Application Program Status Register, APSR<BR>&nbsp; Holds flags that can be written by application-level software, that is, by unprivileged software. APSR handling of application-level writable flags by the MSR and MRS instructions is consistent across all ARMv7 profiles.<BR>* Interrupt Program Status Register, IPSR<BR>When the processor is executing an exception handler, holds the exception number of the exception being processed. Otherwise, the IPSR value is zero.<BR>* Execution Program Status Register, EPSR<BR>&nbsp; Holds execution state bits.</P>
<P>Software can use the MRS and MSR instructions.to access the complete PSR, or any combination of one or more of the subregisters. xPSR is a generic term for a program status register.</P>
<P>Figure B1-1 shows how the APSR, IPSR, and EPSR combine to form the PSR.</P>
