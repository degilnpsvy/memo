B3.5.5 MPU Region Number Register, MPU_RNR</P>
<P>The MPU_RNR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Selects the region currently accessed by MPU_RBAR and MPU_RSAR.<BR>Usage constraints: Used with MPU_RBAR and MPU_RSAR, see MPU Region Base Address Register, MPU_RBAR on page B3-770, and MPU Region Attribute and Size Register, MPU_RASR on page B3-771.<BR>&nbsp; If an implementation supports N regions then the regions number from 0 to (N-1), and the effect of writing a value of N or greater to the REGION field is UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Implemented only if the processor implements an MPU.<BR>Attributes: See Table B3-44 on page B3-765.</P>
<P>[31:8] - Reserved</P>
<P>[7:0] REGION<BR>Indicates the memory region accessed by MPU_RBAR and MPU_RSAR.</P>
<P>Normally, software must write the required region number to MPU_RNR to select the required memory region, before accessing MPU_RBAR or MPU_RSAR. However, the MPU_RBAR.VALID bit gives an alternative way of writing to MPU_RBAR to update a region base address without first writing the region number to MPU_RNR, see MPU Region Base Address Register, MPU_RBAR.
