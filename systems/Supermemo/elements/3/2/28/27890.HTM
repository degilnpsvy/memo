B3.5.6 MPU Region Base Address Register, MPU_RBAR
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_RBAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds the base address of the region identified by MPU_RNR. On a write, can also be used to update the base address of a specified region, in the range 0 to 15, updating MPU_RNR with the new region number.<BR>Usage constraints:<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; Normally, used with MPU_RBAR, see MPU Region Number Register, MPU_RNR on page B3-769.<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; The minimum region alignment required by an MPU_RBAR is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. See the register description for more information about permitted region sizes.<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; If an implementation supports N regions then the regions number from 0 to (N-1). If N is less than 16 the effect of writing a value of N or greater to the REGION field is UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Implemented only if the processor implements an MPU.<BR>Attributes: See Table B3-44 on page B3-765.</P>
<P>[31:5] ADDR Base address of the region.</P>
<P>[4] VALID<BR>On writes, indicates whether the region to update is specified by MPU_RNR.REGION,&nbsp; or by the REGION value specified in this write. When using the REGION value specified by this&nbsp; write, MPU_RNR.REGION is updated to this value.<BR>0 = Update the base address of the region indicated by MPU_RNR, ignoring the value of the REGION field.<BR>1 = On writes to the register, indicates whether the write must update the base address of the region identified by the REGION field. updating the MPU_RNR to indicate this new region:<BR>This bit reads as zero.</P>
<P>[3:0] REGION On writes, can specify the number of the region to update, see VALID field description. On reads, returns bits [3:0] of MPU_RNR.</P>
<P>Software can find the minimum size of region supported by an MPU region by writing all ones to MPURBAR[31:5] for that region, and then reading the register to find the value saved to bits [31:5]. The number of trailing zeros in this bit field indicates the minimum supported alignment and therefore the supported region size. An implementation must support all region size values from the minimum supported to 4GB, see the description of the MPU_RASR.SIZE field in MPU Region Attribute and Size Register, MPU_RASR.</P>
<P>Software must ensure that the value written to the ADDR field aligns with the size of the selected region.
