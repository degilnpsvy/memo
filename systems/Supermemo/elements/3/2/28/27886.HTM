B3.5.4 MPU Control Register, MPU_CTRL 
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_CTRL Register characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Enables the MPU, and when the MPU is enabled, controls whether the default memory map is enabled as a background region for privileged accesses, and whether the MPU is enabled for HardFaults, NMIs, and exception handlers when FAULTMASK is set to 1.<BR>Usage constraints: There are no usage constraints.<BR>Configurations: If the MPU is not implemented, this register is RAZ/WI.<BR>Attributes: See Table B3-44 on page B3-765.</P>
<P>[31:3] - Reserved</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>[2] PRIVDEFENA<BR>When the ENABLE bit is set to 1, the meaning of this bit is:<BR>&nbsp; 0 = Disables the default memory map. Any instruction or data access that does not access a defined region faults.<BR>&nbsp; 1 = Enables the default memory map as a background region for privileged access. The background region acts as region number -1. All memory regions configured in the MPU take priority over the default memory map. The system address map on page B3-704 describes the default memory map.<BR>&nbsp; When the ENABLE bit is set to 0, the processor ignores the PRIVDEFENA bit.<BR>&nbsp; If no regions are enabled and the PRIVDEFENA and ENABLE bits are set to 1, only privileged code can execute from the system address map.</FONT><BR>&nbsp; <BR><FONT class=extract>[1] HFNMIENA<BR>When the ENABLE bit is set to 1, controls whether handlers executing with priority less than 0 access memory with the MPU enabled or with the MPU disabled. This applies to HardFaults, NMIs, and exception handlers when FAULTMASK is set to 1:<BR>0 = Disables the MPU for these handlers.<BR>1 = Use the MPU for memory accesses by these handlers.<BR>If HFNMIENA is set to 1 when ENABLE is set to 0, behavior is UNPREDICTABLE.</FONT></P>
<P>[0] ENABLE<BR>Enables the MPU:<BR>0 = The MPU is disabled.<BR>1 = The MPU is enabled.</P>
<P>Disabling the MPU, by setting the ENABLE bit to 0, means that privileged and unprivileged accesses use<BR>the default memory map.
