ARMv7-M specific support 
<P></P>
<P>ARMv7-M supports the standard PMSAv7 of the ARMv7-R architecture profile, with the following extensions:<BR><FONT class=extract>&#8226; An optimized two register update model, where software can select the region to update by writing to the MPU Region Base Address Register. This optimization applies to the first sixteen memory regions (0 &#8804; RegionNumber &#8804; 0xF) only.</FONT><BR>&#8226; <FONT class=extract>The MPU Region Base Address Register and the MPU Region Attribute and Size Register pairs are aliased in three consecutive dual-word locations. Using the two register update model, software can modify up to four regions by writing the appropriate even number of words using a single STM multi-word store instruction.</FONT>
