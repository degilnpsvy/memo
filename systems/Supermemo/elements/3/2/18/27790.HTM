4.8.4 ICSR</P>
<P>The existing ICSR register is modified as follows:</P>
<P>PENDSTCLR (Bit[25]) This bit is banked between the non-secure and secure states.<BR>PENDSTSET (Bit[26]) This bit is banked between the non-secure and secure states.<BR>PENDSVCLR (Bit[27]) This bit is banked between the non-secure and secure states.<BR>PENDSVSET (Bit[28]) This bit is banked between the non-secure and secure states.<BR>PENDNMICLR (Bit[30]) Similar to other clear bits in the ICSR register, writing a 1 to this registers clears a pending NMI. Since there are some situations where NMI can be pre-empted or pended be a secure HardFault, greater created control over NMI can be useful. This field behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the non-secure state if AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set to 0.<BR>PENDNMISET (Bit[31]) Behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the non-secure state if AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set to 0.
