4.8.3 SCR</P>
<P>The existing SCR register is modified as follows:</P>
<P>SLEEPONEXIT (Bit[1]) This bit is banked between the security states. The secure version of the field is used if the background code being returned to is secure, otherwise the non-secure version is used.</P>
<P>SLEEPDEEP (Bit[2]) This bit remains unbanked, however access to this bit is controlled by the SLEEPDEEPS bit</P>
<P>SLEEPDEEPS (Bit[3]) Sleep deep secure. This field controls whether the SLEEPDEEP bit is only accessible from the secure state:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 = The SLEEPDEEP bit accessible from both security states<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 = The SLEEPDEEP bit behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the non-secure state<BR>&nbsp; This bit is only accessible from the secure state, and behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the non-secure state. If a processor doesn't implement the deep sleep state this bit behaves as RAZ/WI from both security states.</P>
<P>SEVONPEND (Bit[4]) This bit is banked between the security states, with each bit controlling the behaviour of interrupts associated with that its domain.
