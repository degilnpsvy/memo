Priority levels, execution priority, exception entry, and execution preemption
<P></P>
<P>Exception priorities determine the order in which the processor handles exceptions:<BR>&#8226; Every exception has a priority level, the exception priority. Three exceptions have fixed priorities, while all others have a priority that can be configured by privileged software.<BR>&#8226; The instruction stream executing on the processor has a priority level associated with it, the execution priority.<BR>&#8226; The execution priority immediately after a reset is the base level of execution priority. Only execution in Thread mode can be at this base level of execution priority.<BR>&#8226; An exception whose exception priority is sufficiently higher than the execution priority becomes active. The concept of sufficiently higher priority relates to priority grouping, see Priority grouping on page B1-636.</P>
<P>Software can boost the execution priority using registers provided for this purpose, otherwise the execution priority is the highest priority of all the active exceptions, see Execution priority and priority boosting on page B1-637 for more information.</P>
<P>When an exception becomes active because its priority is sufficiently higher that the executing priority:<BR>&#8226; its exception handler preempts the currently running instruction stream<BR>&#8226; its priority becomes the executing priority</P>
<P>When an exception other than reset preempts an instruction stream, the processor automatically saves key context information onto the stack, and execution branches to the code pointed to by the corresponding exception vector.</P>
<P>An exception can occur during exception activation, for example as a result of a memory fault when pushing context information. Also, the architecture permits the optimization of a late-arriving exception. Exceptions on exception entry on page B1-662 describes the behavior of these cases.</P>
<P>The processor always runs an exception handler in Handler mode. If the exception preempts software running in Thread mode the processor changes to Handler mode as part of the exception entry.
