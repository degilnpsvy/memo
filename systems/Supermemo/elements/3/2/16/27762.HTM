B1.3.3 Execution state 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ARMv7-M only executes Thumb instructions, as described in The ARMv7-M architecture profile on page A1-33. This means it is always executing in Thumb state.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The ARMv7 architecture profiles use a value of 1 for an execution status bit, the EPSR.T to indicate execution in Thumb state, see The special-purpose program status registers, xPSR on page B1-624.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Setting EPSR.T to zero in an ARMv7-M processor causes a fault when the next instruction executes, because in this state all instructions are UNDEFINED.</FONT>
