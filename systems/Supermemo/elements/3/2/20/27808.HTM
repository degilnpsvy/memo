Observability and completion 
<P></P>
<P>The set of observers that can observe a memory access is defined by the system.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>For all memory:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&#8226; a write to a location in memory is said to be observed by an observer when a subsequent read of the location by the same observer will return the value written by the write<BR>&#8226; a write to a location in memory is said to be globally observed for a shareability domain when a subsequent read of the location by any observer within that shareability domain that is capable of observing the write will return the value written by the write<BR>&#8226; a read of a location in memory is said to be observed by an observer when a subsequent write to the location by the same observer will have no effect on the value returned by the read<BR>&#8226; a read of a location in memory is said to be globally observed for a shareability domain when a subsequent write to the location by any observer within that shareability domain that is capable of observing the write will have no effect on the value returned by the read.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Additionally, for Strongly-ordered memory:<BR>&#8226; A read or write of a memory-mapped location in a peripheral that exhibits side-effects is said to be observed, and globally observed, only when the read or write:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; meets the general conditions listed<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; can begin to affect the state of the memory-mapped peripheral<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; can trigger all associated side effects, whether they affect other peripheral devices, processors, or memory.</FONT><BR>&nbsp; <BR><FONT class=extract>For all memory, the ARMv7-M completion rules are defined as:<BR>&#8226; A read or write is complete for a shareability domain when all of the following are true:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; the read or write is globally observed for that shareability domain<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; any instruction fetches by observers within the shareability domain have observed the read or write.<BR>&#8226; A cache or branch predictor maintenance operation is complete for a shareability domain when the effects of operation are globally observed for that shareability domain.</FONT>
