A3.7 Memory access order 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ARMv7 provides a set of three memory types, Normal, Device, and Strongly-ordered, with well-defined memory access properties.</FONT></P>
<P>The ARMv7 application-level view of the memory attributes is described in:<BR>&#8226; Memory types and attributes and the memory order model on page A3-99<BR>&#8226; Access rights on page A3-109.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>When considering memory access ordering, an important feature is the Shareable memory attribute that indicates whether a region of memory can be shared between multiple processors, and therefore requires an appearance of cache transparency in the ordering model.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The key issues with the memory order model depend on the target audience:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&#8226; For software programmers, considering the model at the application level, the key factor is that for accesses to Normal memory, barriers are required in some situations where the order of accesses observed by other observers must be controlled.<BR>&#8226; For silicon implementers, considering the model at the system level, the Strongly-ordered and Device memory attributes place certain restrictions on the system designer in terms of what can be built and when to indicate completion of an access.</FONT></P>
<P>Note<BR>Implementations remain free to choose the mechanisms required to implement the functionality of the memory model.</P>
<P>More information about the memory order model is given in the following subsections:<BR>&#8226; Reads and writes<BR>&#8226; Ordering requirements for memory accesses on page A3-114<BR>&#8226; Memory barriers on page A3-116.</P>
<P>Additional attributes and behaviors relate to the memory system architecture. These features are defined in the system level section of this manual, see Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7 on page B3-761.
