6.13.2 SFAR 
<P></P>
<P>Secure Fault Address Register, address 0xE000EDE8, Resets to UNKNOWN.</P>
<P>Usage constraints:<BR>* Only accessible from the secure privileged state, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault and accesses from the privileged non-secure state behave as RAZ/WI (see section 11.3.4 for rational).</P>
<P>ADDRESS (bit[31:0]) The address of an access that caused an attribution unit violation. This field is only valid when SFSR.SFARVALID is set. This allows the actual flip flops associated with this register to be shared with other fault address registers. If an implementation chooses to share the storage in this way care must be taken to not leak secure address information to the public state. One way of accomplishing this is to share the SFAR register with the MMFAR_S register, which is not accessible to the non-secure state.
