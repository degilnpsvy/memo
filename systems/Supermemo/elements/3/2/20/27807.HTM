Synchronization primitives 
<P></P>
<P>Synchronization primitives must ensure correct operation of system semaphores in the memory order model. The synchronization primitive instructions are defined as those instructions that are used to ensure memory synchronization:</P>
<P>&#8226; LDREX, STREX, LDREXB, STREXB, LDREXH, STREXH.</P>
<P>For details of the Load-Exclusive, Store-Exclusive and Clear-Exclusive instructions see Synchronization and semaphores on page A3-89.</P>
<P>The Load-Exclusive and Store-Exclusive instructions are supported to Shareable and Non-shareable memory. Non-shareable memory can be used to synchronize processes that are running on the same processor. Shareable memory must be used to synchronize processes that might be running on different processors.
