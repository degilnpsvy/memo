Two terms used in describing the memory access ordering requirements are:<BR><FONT class=clozed>Address dependency<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An address dependency exists when the value returned by a read access is used to compute the address of a subsequent read or write access. An address dependency exists even if the value read by the first read access does not change the address of the second read or write access. This might be the case if the value returned is masked off before it is used, or if it has no effect on the predicted address value for the second access.<BR>Control dependency<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A control dependency exists when the data value returned by a read access is used to determine the condition code flags, and the values of the flags are used for condition code evaluation to determine the address of a subsequent read access. This address determination might be through conditional execution, or through the evaluation of a branch</FONT>
