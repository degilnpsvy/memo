Synchronization requirements for System Control Space updates</P>
<P>The architecture defines the SCS as Strongly-ordered memory. In addition to the rules for the behavior of Strongly-ordered memory, the architecture requires that the side-effects of any access to the SCS that performs a context-altering operation take effect when the access completes. Software can issue a DSB instruction to guarantee completion of a previous SCS access.</P>
<P>The architecture guarantees the visibility of the effects of a context-altering operation only for instructions fetched after the completion of the SCS access that performed the context-altering operation. Executing an ISB instruction, or performing an exception entry or exception return, guarantees the refetching of any instructions that have been fetched but not executed.</P>
<P>To guarantee that the side effects of a previous SCS access are visible, software can execute a a DSB instruction followed by an ISB instruction.
