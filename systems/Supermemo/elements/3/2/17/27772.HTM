4.4.2.1 MPU_CTRL.HFNMIENA
<P></P>
<P>The behavior of the banked MPU_CTRL.HFNMIENA bit is modified such that it disables the MPU if the requested priority for the security domain the MPU is associated with is negative. This ensures the expected behavior for each security domain independent of the configuration of the other domain (E.G. MPU_CTRL.HFNMIENA can disable the non-secure MPU if FAULTMASK_NS is set regardless of whether AIRCR.PRIS is restricting the actual execution priority ot 0x80).
