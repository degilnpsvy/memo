4.4.2 MPU extensions 
<P></P>
<P>The MPU registers (i.e. MPU_*) are banked with security; For data accesses the MPU memory attribution and privilege checking uses the configuration registers corresponding to <FONT class=clozed>the processors currently executing security state</FONT>. For instruction fetches the MPU uses the configuration registers associated with <FONT class=clozed>the security of the address being fetched (see Security attribution)</FONT>. This behavior means that the secure MPU will be used when performing access checks on guard instructions when entering the secure state, which is useful when virtualizing multiple secure unprivileged states.</P>
<P>NOTE: As the banking of the MPU registers includes the MPU_TYPE register, it is permitted for implementations to have different numbers of MPU regions (including zero regions) in each security state.
