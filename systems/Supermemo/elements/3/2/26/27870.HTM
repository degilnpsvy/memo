of SFSR Secure Fault Status Register 
<P></P>
<P>Invalid entry point. This exception is raised if an invalid entry to the secure state is attempted (E.G. a function call from the non-secure state targets a non-SG instruction in secure memory, the vector for a secure exception targets non-secure memory, etc).
