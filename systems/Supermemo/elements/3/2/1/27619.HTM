Unindexed addressing<BR><FONT class=clozed>Means addressing in which the base register value is used directly as the address to send to memory, without adding or subtracting an offset. In most types of load/store instruction, unindexed addressing is performed by using offset addressing with an immediate offset of 0. The LDC, LDC2, STC, and STC2 instructions have an explicit unindexed addressing mode that permits the offset field in the instruction to be used to specify additional coprocessor options.</FONT>
