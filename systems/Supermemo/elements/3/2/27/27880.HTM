Sub-region support 
<P></P>
<P>For regions of 256 bytes or larger, the region can be divided up into eight sub-regions of size 2^(N-3). Sub-regions within a region can be disabled on an individual basis (8 disable bits) with respect to the associated region attribute register. <FONT class=extract>When a sub-region is disabled, an access match is required from another region, or background matching if enabled. If an access match does not occur a fault is generated.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Region sizes below 256 bytes do not support sub-regions. The sub-region disable field is SBZ/UNP for regions of less than 256 bytes in size.</FONT>
