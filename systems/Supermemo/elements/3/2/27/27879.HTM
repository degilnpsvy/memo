B3.5.1 PMSAv7-compliant MPU operation 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ARMv7-M only supports a unified memory model with respect to MPU region support. All enabled regions provide support for instruction and data accesses.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The base address, size and attributes of a region are all configurable, with the general rule that all regions are naturally aligned. This can be stated as:<BR>RegionBaseAddress[(N-1):0] = 0, where N is log2(SizeofRegion_in_bytes)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Memory regions can vary in size as a power of 2. The supported sizes are 2^N, where 5 &#8804; N &#8804; 32. Where there is an overlap between two regions, the register with the highest region number takes priority.</FONT>
