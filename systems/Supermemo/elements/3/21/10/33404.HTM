The MPU Type Register indicates how many regions the MPU for the selected Security state supports.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED90.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_TYPE_NS located at 0xE002ED90. The location 0xE002ED90 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.

<P>The MPU_TYPE bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:16]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>DREGION, bits [15:8]<BR>Data regions. Number of regions supported by the MPU.<BR>If this field reads-as-zero, the PE does not implement an MPU for the selected Security state.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [7:1]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SEPARATE, bit [0]<BR>Separate. Indicates support for separate instructions and data address regions.<BR>ARMv8-M only supports unified MPU regions.<BR>This bit reads as zero.
