Specifies the access privileges for coprocessors and the FP Extension.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED88.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CPACR_NS located at 0xE002ED88. The location 0xE002ED88 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.

<P>The CPACR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>CP11, bits [23:22]<BR>CP11 Privilege. The value in this field is ignored. If the implementation does not include the FP Extension, this field is RAZ/WI. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the CP10 field, then the value is UNKNOWN.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>CP10, bits [21:20]<BR>CP10 Privilege. Defines the access rights for the floating-point functionality.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00 All accesses to the FP Extension result in NOCP UsageFault.<BR>0b01 Unprivileged accesses to the FP Extension result in NOCP UsageFault.<BR>0b11 Full access to the FP Extension.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>The features controlled by this field are the execution of any floating-point instruction and access to any floating-point registers D0-D16. If the implementation does not include the FP Extension, this field is RAZ/WI. See individual floating-point instruction pages for details.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [19:16]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>CPm, bits [2m+1:2m], for m = 0-7<BR>Coprocessor m privilege. Controls access privileges for coprocessor m.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00 Access denied. Any attempted access generates a NOCP UsageFault.<BR>0b01 Privileged access only. An unprivileged access generates a NOCP UsageFault.<BR>0b10 Reserved.<BR>0b11 Full access.<BR>If coprocessor m is not implemented, this field is RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
