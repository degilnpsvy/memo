Exception processing <FONT class=clozed>automatically</FONT> updates the SHCSR fields. However, software can write to the register to add or remove the pending or active state of an exception. When updating the SHCSR, ARM recommends using a <FONT class=clozed>read-modify-write</FONT> sequence, to avoid unintended effects on the state of the exception handlers.
