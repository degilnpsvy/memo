1) Introduction</P>
<P>TCG (Tiny Code Generator) is a code generator which translates<BR>code fragments ("basic blocks") from target code (any of the<BR>targets supported by QEMU) to a code representation which<BR>can be run on a host.</P>
<P>QEMU can create native code for some hosts (arm, i386, ia64, ppc, ppc64,<BR>s390, sparc, x86_64). For others, unofficial host support was written.</P>
<P>By adding a code generator for a virtual machine and using an<BR>interpreter for the generated bytecode, it is possible to<BR>support (almost) any host.</P>
<P>This is what TCI (Tiny Code Interpreter) does.
