Provides indirect read and write access to the limit address of the currently selected SAU region.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDE0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI when accessed as Non-secure.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.

<P>The SAU_RLAR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>LADDR, bits [31:5]<BR>Limit address. Holds bits [31:5] of the limit address for the selected SAU region.<BR>Bits [4:0] of the limit address are defined as 0x1F.<BR>This field resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [4:2]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>NSC, bit [1]<BR>Non-secure callable. Controls whether Non-secure state is permitted to execute an SG instruction from this region.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Region is not Non-secure callable.<BR>1 Region is Non-secure callable.<BR>This bit resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>ENABLE, bit [0]<BR>Enable. SAU region enable.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 SAU region is disabled.<BR>1 SAU region is enabled.<BR>This bit resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.
