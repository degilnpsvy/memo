Sets or reads interrupt priorities.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000E400 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via NVIC_IPR&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002E400 + 4n. The location 0xE002E400 + 4n is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.

<P>The NVIC_IPR&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:</P>
<P>PRI_Nm, bits [8m+7:8m], for m = 0 to 3<BR>Priority 'N'+m. For register NVIC_IPRn, this field indicates and allows modification of the priority of interrupt number 4n+m, or is RES0 if the PE does not implement this interrupt.<BR>If the PE implements fewer than 8 bits of priority, then the least significant bits of this field are RES0. If interrupt number 4n+3 targets Secure state, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
