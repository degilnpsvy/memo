Provides IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED fault status information.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED3C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via AFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED3C. The location 0xE002ED3C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
