Sets or returns priority for system handlers 4 - 7.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED18.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SHPR1_NS located at 0xE002ED18. The location 0xE002ED18 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states on a bit by bit basis.
