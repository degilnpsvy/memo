Exception processing <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> updates the SHCSR fields. However, software can write to the register to add or remove the pending or active state of an exception. When updating the SHCSR, ARM recommends using a read-modify-write sequence, to avoid unintended effects on the state of the exception handlers.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing the active state of an exception can change the current execution priority, and affect the exception return consistency checks. If software removes the active state, causing a change in current execution priority, this can defeat the architectural behavior that prevents an exception from preempting its own handler.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pending state bits are set to one when an exception occurs and are cleared to zero when the exception becomes active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active state bits are set to one when the associated exception becomes active.
