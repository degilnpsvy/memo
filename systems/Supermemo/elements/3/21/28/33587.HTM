I use two basic partition schemes. The first is for a desktop. I make 4 partitions, <FONT class=clozed><TT class=FILENAME>/</TT>, <TT class=FILENAME>/home</TT>, <TT class=FILENAME>/usr/local</TT>, and swap. This lets me re-install or upgrade the entire installation under <TT class=FILENAME>/</TT> without wiping out my data files under /home or my custom compiled applications under <TT class=FILENAME>/usr/local</TT></FONT>. For servers, <FONT class=clozed>I often replace the <TT class=FILENAME>/usr/local</TT> partition with a <TT class=FILENAME>/var</TT> partition. Many different servers store information on that partition and having it kept separate from <TT class=FILENAME>/</TT> has certain performance benefits</FONT>.
