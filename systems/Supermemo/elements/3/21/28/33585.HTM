<H1 class=SECT1><A id=INSTALLATION-SETUP name=INSTALLATION-SETUP>3.4 The <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT> Program</A></H1>
<P>Once you have created your partitions, you are ready to install Slackware. The next step in the installation process is running the <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT>(8) program. To do so, simply type <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT> at the shell prompt. <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT> is a menu-driven system for actually installing the Slackware packages and configuring your system.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN981 name=AEN981></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-program-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>The setup process goes something like this: You step through each option in the <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT> program, in the order they are listed. (Of course, you are free to do things in almost any order you choose, but chances are it isn't going to work out very well.) Menu items are selected using the up and down arrow keys, and the &#8220;Okay&#8221; and &#8220;Cancel&#8221; buttons can be chosen by using the left and right arrow keys. Alternatively, each option has a corresponding key, which is highlighted in the option name. Options which are flaggable (those indicated with a <VAR class=LITERAL>[X]</VAR>) are toggled using the spacebar.</P>
<P>Of course, all of that is described in the &#8220;help&#8221; section of <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT>, but we believe in giving our readers their money's worth.</P>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN993 name=AEN993>3.4.1 HELP</A></H2>
<P>If this is your first time installing Slackware, you might want to take a look at the help screen. It will give a description of each part of <TT class=COMMAND>setup</TT> (much like the one we're writing now, but less involved) and instructions for navigating the rest of the install.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN997 name=AEN997></A>

<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1001 name=AEN1001>3.4.2 KEYMAP</A></H2>
<P>If you require a keymap other than the United States &#8220;qwerty&#8221; layout, you may want to take a look at this section. It offers a number of alternate layouts for your keyboarding enjoyment.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1009 name=AEN1009></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-keymap-w.png"></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1013 name=AEN1013>3.4.3 ADDSWAP</A></H2>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1015 name=AEN1015></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-swap-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>If you created a swap partition (back in <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation-partitioning.html">Section 3.3</A>), this section will allow you to enable it. It will autodetect and display the swap partitions on your hard drive, allowing you to select one to format and enable.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1023 name=AEN1023>3.4.4 TARGET</A></H2>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1025 name=AEN1025></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-target-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>The target section is where your other (non-swap) partitions are formatted and mapped to filesystem mount points. A list of the partitions on your hard disk will be displayed. For each partition, you will be given the option of whether to format that partition or not. Depending on the kernel used, you can choose between reiserfs (the default), ext3, ext2, jfs, and xfs. Most people use either reiserfs or ext3. In the near future we may see support for reiserfs4 slip in.</P>
<P>The first option in the target section is the selection of a partition on which to install your root (<TT class=FILENAME>/</TT>) filesystem. After that, you will be able to map other partitions to filesystems as you choose. (For instance, you may want your third partition, say <TT class=FILENAME>/dev/hda3</TT>, to be your home filesystem. This is just an example; map the partitions as you see fit.)</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1035 name=AEN1035>3.4.5 SOURCE</A></H2>
<P>The source section is where you select the source media from which you are installing Slackware. Currently there are four sources to choose from. These are CD-ROM, NFS, or a premounted directory.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1038 name=AEN1038></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-source-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>The CD-ROM selection enables a CD-ROM based installation. It will offer the option of scanning for a CD-ROM drive or displaying a list from which you can pick your drive type. Make sure you have the Slackware CD in your drive before allowing it to scan.</P>
<P>The NFS selection prompts for your network information and the network information for your NFS server. The NFS server must be set up in advance. Also note that you cannot use hostnames, you must use the IP addresses for both your machine and the NFS server (there is no name resolver on the setup disk). Naturally you must have used the <TT class=FILENAME>network.dsk</TT> floppy to add support for your network controller.</P>
<P>The premounted directory offers the most flexibility. You can use this method to install from things such as Jaz disks, NFS mounts over PLIP, and FAT filesystems. Mount the filesystem to a location of your choosing before running setup, then specify that location here.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1054 name=AEN1054>3.4.6 SELECT</A></H2>
<P>The select option allows you to select the software series that you wish to install. These series are described in <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation-requirements.html#INSTALLATION-SOFTWARE-SERIES">Section 3.2.1</A>. <FONT class=extract>Please note that you must install the A series to have a working base system. All other series are optional.</FONT></P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1058 name=AEN1058></A>

<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1062 name=AEN1062>3.4.7 INSTALL</A></H2>
<P>Assuming that you have gone through the &#8220;target&#8221;, &#8220;source&#8221;, and &#8220;select&#8221; options, the <VAR class=OPTION>install</VAR> option will allow you to select packages from your chosen software series. If not, it will prompt you to go back and complete the other sections of the setup program. This option allows you to select from six different installation methods: <VAR class=OPTION>full</VAR>, <VAR class=OPTION>newbie</VAR>, <VAR class=OPTION>menu</VAR>, <VAR class=OPTION>expert</VAR>, <VAR class=OPTION>custom</VAR>, and <VAR class=OPTION>tag path</VAR>.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1077 name=AEN1077></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-install-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>The <VAR class=OPTION>full</VAR> option will install every package from all the software series that you chose in the &#8220;select&#8221; section. There is no further prompting. This is the easiest installation method, since you do not need to make any decisions on the actual packages to install. Of course, this option also takes up the most hard drive space.</P>
<P>The next option is <VAR class=OPTION>newbie</VAR>. This option installs all of the required packages in the selected series. For all other packages, it offers a prompt where you can select &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;No&#8221;, or &#8220;Skip&#8221;. Yes and No do the obvious, while Skip will go ahead to the next software series. Additionally, you will see a description and size requirement for each package to help you decide if you need it. We recommend this option for new users, as it ensures that you get all the required packages installed. However, it is a little slow because of the prompting.</P>
<P><VAR class=OPTION>Menu</VAR> is a faster and more advanced version of the newbie option. For each series, a menu is displayed, from which you can select all the non-required packages you want to install. Required packages are not displayed on this menu.</P>
<P>For the more advanced user, install offers the <VAR class=OPTION>expert</VAR> option. This allows you complete control over what packages get installed. You can deselect packages that are absolutely required, resulting in a broken system. On the other hand, you can control exactly what goes onto your system. Simply select the packages from each series that you want installed. This is not recommended for the new user, as it is quite easy to shoot yourself in the foot.</P>
<P>The <VAR class=OPTION>custom</VAR> and <VAR class=OPTION>tag path</VAR> options are also for advanced users. These options allow you to install based upon custom tag files that you created in the distribution tree. This is useful for installing to large numbers of machines fairly quickly. For more information on using tag files, see <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management-making-tags-and-tagfiles.html">Section 18.4</A>.</P>
<P>After selecting your installation method, one of a few things will happen. If you selected full or menu, a menu screen will appear, allowing you to select the packages to be installed. If you selected full, packages will immediately start getting installed to the target. If you selected newbie, packages will be installed until an optional package is reached.</P>
<P>Note that it is possible to run out of space while installing. If you selected too many packages for the amount of free space on the target device, you will have problems. The safest thing to do is to select some software and add more later, if you need it. This can easily be done using Slackware's package management tools. For this information, see <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/package-management.html">Chapter 18</A>.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A id=AEN1100 name=AEN1100>3.4.8 CONFIGURE</A></H2>
<P>The configure section allows you to do some basic system configuration, now that the packages have been installed. What you see here depends in large part upon which software you have installed. You will, however, always see the following:</P>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1103 name=AEN1103>3.4.8.1 Kernel selection</A></H3>
<P>Here you will be asked to select a kernel to install. You can install the kernel from the boot disk you used to install, the Slackware CD-ROM, or from another floppy which you (always thinking ahead) have prepared. Or you can elect to skip, in which case the default kernel will be installed and play will continue to the dealer's left.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1106 name=AEN1106></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-kernel-w.png"></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1110 name=AEN1110>3.4.8.2 Make a boot disk</A></H3>
<P>Making a boot disk for future use is probably a good idea. You will have the option of formatting a floppy and then creating one of two types of boot disk. The first type, <VAR class=OPTION>simple</VAR>, simply (go figure) writes a kernel to the floppy. A more flexible (and highly recommended) option is <VAR class=OPTION>lilo</VAR>, which will of course create a lilo boot disk. See LILO in <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/booting.html#BOOTING-LILO">Section 7.1</A> for more information. Of course, you may also choose to simply <VAR class=LITERAL>continue</VAR>, in which case no boot disk will be made.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1119 name=AEN1119></A>

<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1123 name=AEN1123>3.4.8.3 Modem</A></H3>
<P>You will be prompted for modem information. More specifically, you will be asked whether you have a modem, and if so, what serial port it is on.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1128 name=AEN1128></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-modem-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>These next configuration subsections may or may not appear, depending on whether or not you installed their corresponding packages.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1133 name=AEN1133>3.4.8.4 Timezone</A></H3>
<P>This one's pretty straightforward: you will be asked what time zone you are in. If you operate on Zulu time, we are very sorry; the (extremely long) list is alphabetically ordered, and you're at the bottom.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1138 name=AEN1138></A>

<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1142 name=AEN1142>3.4.8.5 Mouse</A></H3>
<P>This subsection simply asks what kind of mouse you have, and whether you want <TT class=COMMAND>gpm</TT>(8) console mouse support enabled on bootup.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1148 name=AEN1148></A>

<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1152 name=AEN1152>3.4.8.6 Hardware clock</A></H3>
<P>This subsection asks if your computer's hardware clock is set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC or GMT). Most PCs are not, so you should probably say no.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1155 name=AEN1155></A>

<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1159 name=AEN1159>3.4.8.7 Font</A></H3>
<P>The font subsection allows you to choose from a list of custom console fonts.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1164 name=AEN1164></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-font-w.png"></P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1168 name=AEN1168>3.4.8.8 LILO</A></H3>
<P>Here you are prompted for installation of LILO (the LInux LOader; see <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/booting.html#BOOTING-LILO">Section 7.1</A> for more information).</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1174 name=AEN1174></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-lilo-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>If Slackware is to be the only operating system on your computer, <VAR class=OPTION>simple</VAR> should work just fine for you. If you are dual-booting, the <VAR class=OPTION>expert</VAR> option is a better choice. See <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/booting-dual.html">Section 7.3</A> for more information on dual-booting. The third option, <VAR class=OPTION>do not install</VAR>, is not recommended unless you know what you're doing and have a very good reason for not installing LILO. If you are performing an expert install, you will be given a choice as to where LILO will be put. You may place LILO in the MBR (Master Boot Record) of your hard drive, in the superblock of your root Linux partition, or on a floppy disk.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1183 name=AEN1183>3.4.8.9 Network</A></H3>
<P>The network configuration subsection is actually <TT class=COMMAND>netconfig</TT>. See <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/network-configuration.html#NETWORK-CONFIGURATION-NETCONFIG">Section 5.1</A> for more information.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A id=AEN1190 name=AEN1190>3.4.8.10 X Window Manager</A></H3>
<P>This subsection will allow you to choose a default window manager for X. See <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/x-window-system.html">Chapter 6</A> for more details on X and window managers.</P>
<DIV class=INFORMALFIGURE><A id=AEN1198 name=AEN1198></A>
<P><IMG src="http://www.slackbook.org/html/installation/setup-xwmconfig-w.png"></P></DIV>
<P>No matter which packages you installed, the last thing configure will do is ask you whether you want to go ahead and set a <TT class=USERNAME>root</TT> password. For security reasons, this is probably a good idea; however, like almost everything else in Slackware, this is your call.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
