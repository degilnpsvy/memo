Provides information about the architecture of the caches. CTR is RES0 if CLIDR is zero.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED7C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CTR_NS located at 0xE002ED7C. The location 0xE002ED7C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.

<P>Bits [30:28]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>CWG, bits [27:24]<BR>Cache Writeback Granule. Log2 of the number of words of the maximum size of memory that can be overwritten as a result of the eviction of a cache entry that has had a memory location in it modified.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000<BR>&nbsp; Indicates that this register does not provide Cache Writeback Granule information and either the architectural maximum of 512 words (2KB) must be assumed, or the Cache Writeback Granule can be determined from maximum cache line size encoded in the Cache Size ID Registers.<BR>0b0001-0b1000<BR>&nbsp; Log2 of the number of words.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>ERG, bits [23:20]<BR>Exclusives Reservation Granule. Log2 of the number of words of the maximum size of the reservation granule that has been implemented for the Load-Exclusive and Store-Exclusive instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000<BR>&nbsp; Indicates that this register does not provide Exclusives Reservation Granule information<BR>and the architectural maximum of 512 words (2KB) must be assumed.<BR>0b0001-0b1000<BR>&nbsp; Log2 of the number of words.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>DminLine, bits [19:16]<BR>Data cache minimum line length. Log2 of the number of words in the smallest cache line of all the data caches and unified caches that are controlled by the PE.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [15:14]<BR>Reserved, RES1.</P>
<P>Bits [13:4]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>IminLine, bits [3:0]<BR>Instruction cache minimum line length. Log2 of the number of words in the smallest cache line of all the instruction caches that are controlled by the PE.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
