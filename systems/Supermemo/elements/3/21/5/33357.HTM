Provides information about the state of the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED authentication interface for debug.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if Halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EFB8.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DAUTHSTATUS_NS located at 0xE002EFB8. The location 0xE002EFB8 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
