<P>Often there are times when you might need help with a specific command, setting up a program, or getting a piece of hardware to work. Maybe you simply want to understand a given command better, or see what other options are available to use with it. Luckily, there are a variety of ways that you can get the help you're looking for. <FONT class=extract>When you install Slackware you have the option of installing packages from the &#8220;F&#8221; series which includes FAQs and HOWTOs.
