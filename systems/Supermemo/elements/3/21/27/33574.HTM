<P>Before you can use Slackware Linux, you'll have to obtain and install it. Getting Slackware is as easy as purchasing it or downloading it for free over the Internet. Installing it is also easy as long as you have some basic knowledge about your computer and are willing to learn a few other things. The installation program itself is very much a step-by-step process. Because of this, you can be up and running very quickly. In fact, Slackware boasts one of the lowest installation times of any full-featured Linux distribution.
