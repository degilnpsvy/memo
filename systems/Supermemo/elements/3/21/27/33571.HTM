<P>The official Slackware Linux CD set is available from Slackware Linux, Inc. The CD set consists of 4 discs. The first disk contains all the software needed for a basic server install, and the X window system. The second cd is a &#8220;live&#8221; cd; that is, a bootable cd that installs into RAM and gives you a temporary installation to play around with or do a data or machine rescue. This cd also contains a few packages such as the KDE and GNOME desktop environments. A few other goodies are included on the second cd including many non-vital packages in the &#8220;extra&#8221; folder. The third and fourth CDs contain the source code to all of Slackware, along with the original edition of this book.</P>
<P>One may also purchase a boxed set that includes the 4 discs and a copy of this book, as well as lots of neat Slackware gear to show off your geek pride. CD subscriptions are available at a reduced rate also.</P>
<P>The preferred method for shopping for Slackware merchandise is online at the Slackware store.</P>

<P>Slackware Linux is also freely available over the Internet. You may email in your support questions, but higher priority will be given to those who have purchased the official CD set. With that said, we get a lot of e-mails and our time is rather limited. Before e-mailing for support consider reading <A href="http://www.slackbook.org/html/help.html">Chapter 2</A> first.</P>
