<H2 class=SECT2><A id=HELP-SYSTEM-MAN name=HELP-SYSTEM-MAN>2.1.1 <TT class=COMMAND>man</TT></A></H2>
<P>The <TT class=COMMAND>man</TT> command (short for &#8220;manual&#8221;) is the traditional form of online documentation in Unix and Linux operating systems. Comprised of specially formatted files, the &#8220;man pages&#8221;, are written for the vast majority of commands and are distributed with the software itself. Executing <TT class=COMMAND>man somecommand</TT> will display the man page for (naturally) the command specified, in our example this would be the imaginary program <TT class=COMMAND>somecommand</TT>.</P>
<P>As you might imagine, the amount of man pages can quickly add up, becoming overly confusing and seriously complicated, even for an advanced user. So, for this reason, man pages are grouped into enumerated sections. This system has been around for a very long time; enough so that you will often see commands, programs, and even programming library functions referred to with their man section number.</P>
<P>For example:</P>
<P>You might see a reference to <TT class=COMMAND>man</TT>(1). The numbering tells you that &#8220;<TT class=COMMAND>man</TT>&#8221; is documented in section 1 (user commands); you can specify that you want the section 1 man page for &#8220;man&#8221; with the command <TT class=COMMAND>man 1 man</TT>. Specifying the section that man should look in is useful in the case of multiple items with the same name.</P>

<P>In addition to <TT class=COMMAND>man</TT>(1), there are the commands <TT class=COMMAND>whatis</TT>(1) and <TT class=COMMAND>apropos</TT>(1) available to you, whose shared purpose is to make it easier to find information in the man system.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The command <TT class=COMMAND>whatis</TT> gives a very brief description of system commands, somewhat in the style of a pocket command reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>The source for most packages that we build comes with some sort of documentation: README files, usage instructions, license files, etc. Any sort of documentation that comes with the source is included and installed on your system in the <TT class=FILENAME>/usr/doc</TT> directory. Each program will (usually) install its own documentation in the order of:</FONT></P>
<P><TT class=FILENAME><FONT class=extract>/usr/doc/<VAR class=REPLACEABLE>$program-$version</VAR></FONT></TT></P>
<P>Where <VAR class=REPLACEABLE>$program</VAR> is the name of the program you are wanting to read about, and <VAR class=REPLACEABLE>$version</VAR> is (obviously) the appropriate version of software package installed on your system.</P>
<P>For example, to read the documentation for the command <TT class=COMMAND>man</TT>(1) you would want to <TT class=COMMAND>cd</TT> to:</P>

<P>It is in the truest spirit of the Open Source community that brings us to the HOWTO/mini-HOWTO collection. These files are exactly what they sound like - documents and guides describing how to do stuff. <FONT class=extract>If you installed the HOWTO collection, the HOWTOs will be installed to <TT class=FILENAME>/usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs</TT> and the mini-HOWTOs to <TT class=FILENAME>/usr/doc/Linux-mini-HOWTOs</TT>.</FONT></P>

<P>These files are well worth reading whenever you're not quite sure how to proceed with something. They cover an amazing range of topics, more often than not in a surprisingly detailed manner. Good stuff!</P></DIV></DIV>
