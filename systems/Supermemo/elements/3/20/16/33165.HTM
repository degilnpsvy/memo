D1.2.211 TPIU_PSCR, TPIU Periodic Synchronization Control Register<BR>The TPIU_PSCR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Defines the reload value for the Periodic Synchronization Counter register. The Periodic<BR>Synchronization Counter decrements for each byte that is output by the TPIU. If the<BR>formatter is implemented and enabled, the TPIU forces completion of the current frame<BR>when the counter reaches zero. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the TPIU forces all<BR>trace sources to generate synchronization packets when the counter reaches zero. Bytes<BR>generated by the TPIU as part of a Halfword synchronization packet or a Full frame<BR>synchronization packet are not counted.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present if the TPIU is implemented and DWT_CYCCNT is not implemented.<BR>OPTIONAL if both the TPIU and DWT_CYCCNT are implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0040308.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_PSCR bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:5]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>PSCount, bits [4:0]<BR>Periodic Synchronization Count. Determines the reload value of the Periodic Synchronization<BR>Counter. The reload value takes effect the next time the counter reaches zero. Reads from this<BR>register return the reload value programmed into this register.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00000 Synchronization disabled.<BR>0b00111 128 bytes.<BR>0b01000 256 bytes.<BR>... ...<BR>0b11111 231 bytes.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>The Periodic Synchronization Counter might have a maximum value smaller than 231. In this case,<BR>if the programmed reload value is greater than the maximum value, then the Periodic<BR>Synchronization Counter is reloaded with its maximum value and the TPIU will generate<BR>synchronization requests at this interval.<BR>This field resets to 0xA on a Cold reset.<BR>Note<BR>In the CoreSight TPIU, TPIU_PSCR specifies the number of frames between synchronizations,<BR>each frame being 16 bytes. This definition of TPIU_PSCR specifies a number of bytes and is<BR>encoded as a power-of-two rather than a plain binary number.
