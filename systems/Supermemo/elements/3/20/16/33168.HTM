D1.2.214 TPIU_TYPE, TPIU Device Identifier Register<BR>The TPIU_TYPE characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Describes the TPIU to a debugger.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if the TPIU is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0040FC8.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_TYPE bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:16]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>Bits [15:12]<BR>IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.<BR>NRZVALID, bit [11]<BR>NRZ valid. Indicates support for SWO using UART/NRZ encoding.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Not supported.<BR>1 Supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.<BR>MANCVALID, bit [10]<BR>Manchester valid. Indicates support for SWO using Manchester encoding.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Not supported.<BR>1 Supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.<BR>PTINVALID, bit [9]<BR>Parallel Trace Interface invalid. Indicates support for parallel trace port operation.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Supported.<BR>1 Not supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.<BR>FIFOSZ, bits [8:6]<BR>FIFO depth. Indicates the minimum implemented size of the TPIU output FIFO for trace data.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0 IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED FIFO depth.<BR>Other Minimum FIFO size is 2FIFOSZ.<BR>For example, a value of 0b011 indicates a FIFO size of at least 23 = 8 bytes.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.<BR>Bits [5:0]<BR>IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.
