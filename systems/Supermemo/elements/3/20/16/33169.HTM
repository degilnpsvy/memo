D1.2.215 <FONT class=extract>TT_RESP, Test Target Response Payload</FONT><BR>The TT_RESP characteristics are:<BR>Purpose <FONT class=clozed>Provides the response information from a TT, TTA, TTT, or TTAT instruction</FONT>.<BR>Usage constraints None.<BR>Configurations All.<BR>Attributes 32-bit payload.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TT_RESP bit assignments are:<BR><FONT class=extract>IREGION, bits [31:24]<BR>IDAU region number. Indicates the IDAU region number containing the target address.<BR>This field is zero if IRVALID is zero.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>IRVALID, bit [23]<BR>IREGION valid flag. For a Secure request, indicates the validity of the IREGION field.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 IREGION content not valid.<BR>1 IREGION content valid.<BR>This bit is always zero if the IDAU cannot provide a region number, the address is exempt from<BR>security attribution, or if the requesting TT instruction was executed from the Non-secure state.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>S, bit [22]<BR>Security. For a Secure request, indicates the Security attribute of the target address.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Target address is Non-secure.<BR>1 Target address is Secure.<BR>This bit is always zero if the requesting TT instruction was executed from the Non-secure state.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>NSRW, bit [21]<BR>Non-secure read and writeable. Equal to RW AND NOT S. Can be used in combination with the<BR>LSLS (immediate) instruction to check both the MPU and SAU/IDAU permissions. This field is<BR>only valid if the instruction was executed from Secure state and the RW field is valid.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>NSR, bit [20]<BR>Non-secure readable. Equal to R AND NOT S. Can be used in combination with the LSLS<BR>(immediate) instruction to check both the MPU and SAU/IDAU permissions. This field is only valid<BR>if the instruction was executed from Secure state and the R field is valid.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>RW, bit [19]<BR>Read and writeable.<BR>Set to 1 if the memory location can be read and written according to the permissions of the selected<BR>MPU when operating in the current mode. For TTT and TTAT, this field returns the permissions for<BR>unprivileged access, regardless of whether the current mode is privileged or unprivileged.<BR>This field is invalid and RAZ if the TT instruction was executed from an unprivileged mode and the<BR>A flag was not specified. This field is also RAZ if the address matches multiple MPU regions.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>R, bit [18]<BR>Readable.<BR>Read accessibility. Set to 1 if the memory location can be read according to the permissions of the<BR>selected MPU when operating in the current mode.

For a Secure request indicates validity of the SREGION field.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 SREGION content not valid.<BR>1 SREGION content valid.<BR>This bit is always zero if the requesting TT instruction was executed from the Non-secure state.<BR>The SREGION field is invalid if any of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; SAU_CTRL.ENABLE is set to zero.<BR>&#8226; The address specified in the SREGION field does not match any enabled SAU regions.<BR>&#8226; The address specified by the SREGION field is exempt from the secure memory attribution.<BR>&#8226; The address specified in the SREGION field matches multiple enabled SAU regions.<BR>&#8226; The TT instruction was executed from the Non-secure state or the Security Extension is not<BR>implemented.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>MRVALID, bit [16]<BR>MREGION valid flag. Indicates validity of the MREGION field.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 MREGION content not valid.<BR>1 MREGION content valid.<BR>This bit is only valid for TT and TTA instructions, executed in the Secure state or in privileged mode<BR>in Non-secure state.<BR>The MREGION field is invalid if any of the following is true:<BR>&#8226; The MPU is not implemented or MPU_CTRL.ENABLE is set to zero.<BR>&#8226; The address specified by the MREGION field does not match any enabled MPU regions.<BR>&#8226; The address matched multiple MPU regions.<BR>&#8226; The TT instruction was executed from an unprivileged mode and the A flag was not<BR>specified.<BR>&#8226; The address specified in the MREGION field is in the System PPB region of the address<BR>space.<BR>&#8226; MPU_CTRL.HFNIMENA is set to zero and the requested execution priority is negative for<BR>the specified Security state.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>SREGION, bits [15:8]<BR>SAU region number.
