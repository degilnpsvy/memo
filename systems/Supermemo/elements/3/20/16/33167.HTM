D1.2.213 TPIU_SSPSR, TPIU Supported Parallel Port Sizes Register<BR>The TPIU_SSPSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Indicates the supported parallel trace port sizes.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if the TPIU is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0040000.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_SSPSR bit assignments are:<BR>SWIDTH, bits [31:0]<BR>Supported width. SWIDTH[m] indicates whether a parallel trace port width of (m+1) is supported.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Parallel trace port width (m+1) not supported.<BR>1 Parallel trace port width (m+1) supported.<BR>The value of this register is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
