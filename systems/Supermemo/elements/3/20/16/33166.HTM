D1.2.212 TPIU_SPPR, TPIU Selected Pin Protocol Register<BR>The TPIU_SPPR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Selects the protocol used for trace output.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>If a debugger changes the register value while the TPIU is transmitting data, the effect on<BR>the output stream is UNPREDICTABLE and the required recovery process is IMPLEMENTATION<BR>DEFINED.<BR>Configurations Present only if the TPIU is implemented and supports SWO.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented or does not support SWO.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE00400F0.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_SPPR bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:2]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>TXMODE, bits [1:0]<BR>Transmit mode. Specifies the protocol for trace output from the TPIU.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00 Parallel trace port mode. This value is reserved if TPIU_TYPE.PTINVALID == 1.<BR>0b01 Asynchronous SWO, using Manchester encoding. This value is reserved if<BR>TPIU_TYPE.MANCVALID == 0.<BR>0b10 Asynchronous SWO, using NRZ encoding. This value is reserved if<BR>TPIU_TYPE.NRZVALID == 0.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>The effect of selecting a reserved value, or a mode that the implementation does not support, is<BR>UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>This field resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Cold reset.
