TENMS, bits [23:0]<BR>Ten milliseconds. Optionally, holds a reload value to be used for 10ms (100Hz) timing, subject to system clock skew errors. If this field is zero, the calibration value is not known.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this field is RES0.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
