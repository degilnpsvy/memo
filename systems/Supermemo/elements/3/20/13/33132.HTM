D1.2.163 <FONT class=extract>NVIC_ICPR&lt;n&gt;, Interrupt Clear Pending Register, n = 0 - 15</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The NVIC_ICPR&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Clears or reads the pending state of each group of 32 interrupts.<BR>Usage constraints:Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000E280 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via NVIC_ICPR&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002E280 + 4n. The location 0xE002E280 + 4n is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The NVIC_ICPR&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>CLRPEND, bits [31:0], on a write<BR>Clear pending. For CLRPEND[m] in NVIC_ICPRn, allows interrupt 32n + m to be unpended.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 No effect.<BR>1 Clear pending state of interrupt 32n + m.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>CLRPEND, bits [31:0], on a read<BR>Clear pending. For CLRPEND[m] in NVIC_ICPRn, indicates whether interrupt 32n + m is pending.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt 32n + m is not pending.<BR>1 Interrupt 32n + m is pending.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure </FONT>
