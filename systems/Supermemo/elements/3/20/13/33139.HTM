D1.2.179 SFAR, Secure Fault Address Register</P>
<P>The SFAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: the address of the memory location that caused a Security violation.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDE8.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI when accessed as Non-secure.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The SFAR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>ADDRESS, bits [31:0]<BR>Address. The address of an access that caused an attribution unit violation. This field is only valid when SFSR.SFARVALID is set. This allows the actual flip flops associated with this register to be shared with other fault address registers. If an implementation chooses to share the storage in this way, care must be taken to not leak Secure address information to the Non-secure state. One way of achieving this is to share the SFAR register with the MMFAR_S register, which is not accessible to the Non-secure state.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
