D1.2.173 SAU_CTRL, SAU Control Register</P>
<P>The SAU_CTRL characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Allows enabling of the Security Attribution Unit.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDD0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI when accessed as Non-secure.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Resets to 0x0 - in this case SAU_REGIONn registers are UNKNOWN at reset.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>The SAU_CTRL bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:2]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>ALLNS, bit [1]<BR>All Non-secure. When SAU_CTRL.ENABLE is 0 this bit controls if the memory is marked as Non-secure or Secure.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Memory is marked as Secure and is not Non-secure callable.<BR>1 Memory is marked as Non-secure.<BR>This bit resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>ENABLE, bit [0]<BR>Enable. Enables the SAU.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The SAU is disabled.<BR>1 The SAU is enabled.<BR>If this register resets to 1, the SAU region registers also reset to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.<BR>This bit resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.
