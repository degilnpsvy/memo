D1.2.35 DDEVTYPE, SCS Device Type Register 
<P></P>
<P>The DDEVTYPE characteristics are:<BR>Purpose:<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if Halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EFCC.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DDEVTYPE_NS located at 0xE002EFCC. The location 0xE002EFCC is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DDEVTYPE bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SUB, bits [7:4]<BR>Subtype. Component subtype.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x0 Other.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.</P>
<P>MAJOR, bits [3:0]<BR>Major type. CoreSight major type.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x0 Miscellaneous.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.
