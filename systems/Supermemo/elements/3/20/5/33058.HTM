D1.2.139 ITM_STIM&lt;n&gt;, ITM Stimulus Port Register, n = 0 - 255
<P></P>
<P>The ITM_STIM&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides the interface for generating Instrumentation packets.<BR>Usage constraints: If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are permitted, but unprivileged writes are ignored if ITM_TPR.PRIVMASK[n DIV 8] is set to one.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; All writes are ignored if ITM_TCR.ITMENA == 0 or ITM_TER&lt;n DIV 32&gt;.STIMENA[n MOD 32] == 0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp; Accesses that are not word aligned are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0000000 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ITM_STIM&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:<BR>On a read: RES0, DISABLED, FIFOREADY<BR>On a write: STIMULUS</P>
<P>STIMULUS, bits [31:0], on a write<BR>Stimulus data. Data to write to the stimulus port output buffer, for forwarding as an Instrumentation<BR>packet. The size of write access determines the type of Instrumentation packet generated.</P>
<P>Bits [31:2], on a read<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>DISABLED, bit [1], on a read<BR>Disabled. Indicates whether the stimulus port is enabled or disabled.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Stimulus port and ITM are enabled.<BR>1 Stimulus port or ITM is disabled.</P>
<P>FIFOREADY, bit [0], on a read<BR>FIFO ready. Indicates whether the stimulus port can accept data.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Stimulus port cannot accept data.<BR>1 Stimulus port can accept at least one word.
