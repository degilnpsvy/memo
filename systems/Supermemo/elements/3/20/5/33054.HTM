D1.2.135 ITM_PIDR4, ITM Peripheral Identification Register 4<BR>The ITM_PIDR4 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provides CoreSight discovery information for the ITM.<BR>Usage constraints If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are<BR>permitted.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0000FD0.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The ITM_PIDR4 bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>SIZE, bits [7:4]<BR>4KB count. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as zero.<BR>DES_2, bits [3:0]<BR>JEP106 continuation code. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
