COUNTFLAG, bit [16]<BR><FONT class=clozed>Count flag. Indicates whether the counter has counted to zero since the last read of this register.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Timer has not counted to 0.<BR>1 Timer has counted to 0.<BR>COUNTFLAG is set to 1 by a count transition from 1 to 0. COUNTFLAG is cleared to 0 if software reads this bit as one, and by any write to the SYST_CVR for the selected Security state. Debugger reads do not clear the COUNTFLAG.<BR>If set this bit clears to zero when read by software. Reads from the debugger do not clear this bit.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset. </FONT>
