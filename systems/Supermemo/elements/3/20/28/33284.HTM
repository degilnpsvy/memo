If the Main Extension is implemented, then two SysTick timers are implemented. 
<P></P>
<P>If the Main Extension is not implemented, then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether none, one or two SysTick timers are implemented. </P>
<P>Where two SysTick timers are implemented, this register is banked. </P>
<P>Where one SysTick timer is implemented, this register is not banked, and Non-secure accesses behave as RAZ/WI if ICSR.STTNS is clear. </P>
<P>If no SysTick timer is implemented, both aliases of this register behave as RES0.
