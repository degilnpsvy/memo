D1.2.95 FP_PIDR1, FP Peripheral Identification Register 1</P>
<P>The FP_PIDR1 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the FP.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the FPB is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0002FE4.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FP_PIDR1 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>DES_0, bits [7:4]<BR>JEP106 identification code bits [3:0]. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>PART_1, bits [3:0]<BR>Part number bits [11:8]. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
