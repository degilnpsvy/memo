D1.2.93 FP_LSR, FPB Software Lock Status Register</P>
<P>The FP_LSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight Software Lock status information for the FPB, see the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification for details.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI if accessed via the debugger.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the FPB is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the optional Software Lock is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI if the Software Lock is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0002FB4.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FP_LSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:3]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>nTT, bit [2]<BR>Not thirty-two bit. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This bit reads as zero.</P>
<P>SLK, bit [1]<BR>Software Lock status. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Lock clear. Software writes are permitted to this component's registers.<BR>1 Lock set. Software writes to this component's registers are ignored, and reads have no side-effects.<BR>For a debugger read of this register, or when the Software Lock is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to one on a Cold reset.</P>
<P>SLI, bit [0]<BR>Software Lock implemented. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Software Lock not implemented or debugger access.<BR>1 Software Lock is implemented and software access.<BR>For a debugger read of this register, or when the Software Lock is not implemented, this bit is RAZ.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
