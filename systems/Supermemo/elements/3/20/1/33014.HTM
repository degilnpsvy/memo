D1.2.92 FP_LAR, FPB Software Lock Access Register
<P></P>
<P>The FP_LAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight Software Lock control for the FPB, see the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification for details.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI if accessed via the debugger.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the FPB is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the optional Software Lock is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI if the Software Lock is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit write-only register located at 0xE0002FB0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FP_LAR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>KEY, bits [31:0]<BR>Lock Access control.<BR>Writing the key value 0xC5ACCE55 to this field unlocks the lock, enabling write accesses to this component's registers through a memory-mapped interface.<BR>Writing any other value to this register locks the lock, disabling write accesses to this component's registers through a memory mapped interface.
