D1.2.89 FP_CTRL, Flash Patch Control Register</P>
<P>The FP_CTRL characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides FPB implementation information, and the global enable for the FPB unit.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the FPB is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0002000.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FP_CTRL bit assignments are:</P>
<P>REV, bits [31:28]<BR>Revision. Flash Patch and Breakpoint Unit architecture revision.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Flash Patch Breakpoint version 2 implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field is read-only.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>Bits [27:15]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>NUM_CODE, bits [14:12,7:4]<BR>Number of implemented code comparators. Indicates the number of implemented instruction address comparators. Zero indicates no Instruction Address comparators are implemented. The Instruction Address comparators are numbered from 0 to NUM_CODE - 1.<BR>This field is read-only.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>NUM_LIT, bits [11:8]<BR>Number of literal comparators. Indicates the number of implemented literal address comparators. The Literal Address comparators are numbered from NUM_CODE to NUM_CODE + NUM_LIT - 1.<BR>If the Flash Patch remap function is not supported, this field is RES0.<BR>This field is read-only.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [3:2]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>KEY, bit [1]<BR>FP_CTRL write-enable key. Writes to the FP_CTRL are ignored unless KEY is concurrently written to one.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Concurrent write to FP_CTRL ignored.<BR>1 Concurrent write to FP_CTRL permitted.<BR>This bit reads-as-zero.</P>
<P>ENABLE, bit [0]<BR>Flash Patch global enable. Enables the FPB.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 All FPB functionality disabled.<BR>1 FPB enabled.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.
