D1.2.200 TPIU_FFSR, TPIU Formatter and Flush Status Register<BR>The TPIU_FFSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Shows the status and capabilities of the TPIU formatter.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if the TPIU is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0040300.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_FFSR bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:4]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>FtNonStop, bit [3]<BR>Non-stop formatter. Indicates the formatter cannot be stopped.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Formatter can be stopped.<BR>1 Formatter cannot be stopped.<BR>If no formatter is implemented, this bit is RAO.<BR>TCPresent, bit [2]<BR>TRACECTL present. Indicates presence of the TRACECTL pin.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No TRACECTL pin is available. The data formatter must be used and only in<BR>continuous mode.<BR>1 The optional TRACECTL pin is present.<BR>If a parallel trace port is not implemented, this bit is RAZ.<BR>Note<BR>If a parallel trace port is implemented, ARM recommends the TRACECTL pin is not implemented.<BR>FtStopped, bit [1]<BR>Formatter stopped. Indicates the formatter is stopped.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Formatter is enabled.<BR>1 The formatter has received a stop request signal and all trace data and post-amble has<BR>been output. Any further trace data is ignored.<BR>If no formatter is implemented, or the formatter cannot be stopped, this bit is RAZ.<BR>FInProg, bit [0]<BR>Flush in progress. Set to 1 when a flush is initiated and clears to zero when all data received before<BR>the flush is acknowledged has been output on the trace port. That is, the trace has been received at<BR>the sink, formatted, and output on the trace port.
