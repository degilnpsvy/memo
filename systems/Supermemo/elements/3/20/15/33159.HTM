D1.2.205 TPIU_PIDR2, TPIU Peripheral Identification Register 2<BR>The TPIU_PIDR2 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provides CoreSight discovery information for the TPIU.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the TPIU is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0040FE8.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_PIDR2 bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>REVISION, bits [7:4]<BR>Component revision.
