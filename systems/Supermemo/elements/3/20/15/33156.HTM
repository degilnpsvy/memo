D1.2.202 TPIU_LSR, TPIU Software Lock Status Register<BR>The TPIU_LSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provides CoreSight Software Lock status information for the TPIU, see the ARM&#174;<BR>CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification for details.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>This register is RAZ/WI if accessed via the debugger.<BR>Configurations Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the TPIU is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the optional Software Lock is implemented.<BR>This register is RAZ/WI if the Software Lock is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0040FB4.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_LSR bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:3]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>nTT, bit [2]<BR>Not thirty-two bit. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This bit reads as zero.<BR>SLK, bit [1]<BR>Software Lock status. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Lock clear. Software writes are permitted to this component's registers.<BR>1 Lock set. Software writes to this component's registers are ignored, and reads have no<BR>side-effects.<BR>For a debugger read of this register, or when the Software Lock is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to one on a Cold reset.<BR>SLI, bit [0]<BR>Software Lock implemented. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Software Lock not implemented or debugger access.<BR>1 Software Lock is implemented and software access.<BR>For a debugger read of this register, or when the Software Lock is not implemented, this bit is RAZ.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
