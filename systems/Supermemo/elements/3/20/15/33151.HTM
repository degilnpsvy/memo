D1.2.197 TPIU_CSPSR, TPIU Current Parallel Port Sizes Register<BR>The TPIU_CSPSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Controls the width of the parallel trace port.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if the TPIU is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0040004.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The TPIU_CSPSR bit assignments are:<BR>CWIDTH, bits [31:0]<BR>Current width. CWIDTH[m] represents a parallel trace port width of (m+1).<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Width (N+1) is not the current parallel trace port width.<BR>1 Width (N+1) is the current parallel trace port width.<BR>A debugger must set only one bit is set to 1, and all others must be zero. The effect of writing a value<BR>with more than one bit set to 1 is UNPREDICTABLE. The effect of a write to an unsupported bit is<BR>UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>This register resets to the value for the smallest supported parallel trace port size.<BR>This field resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Cold reset.
