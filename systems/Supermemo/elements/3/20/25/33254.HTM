Clear pending. For CLRPEND[m] in NVIC_ICPRn, allows interrupt 32n + m to be unpended.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 No effect.<BR>1 Clear pending state of interrupt 32n + m.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.
