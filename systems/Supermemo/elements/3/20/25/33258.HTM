No reference. Indicates whether the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED reference clock is implemented.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Reference clock is implemented.<BR>1 Reference clock is not implemented.<BR>When this bit is 1, the CLKSOURCE bit of the SYST_CSR register is forced to 1 and cannot be cleared to 0.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
