D1.2.149 MPU_MAIR1, MPU Memory Attribute Indirection Register 1</P>
<P>The MPU_MAIR1 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Along with MPU_MAIR0, provides the memory attribute encodings corresponding to the AttrIndx values.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDC4.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_MAIR1_NS located at 0xE002EDC4. The location 0xE002EDC4 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if no MPU regions are implemented in the corresponding Security state.</P>
<P>The MPU_MAIR1 bit assignments are:<BR>Attrm, bits [8(m-4)+7:8(m-4)], for m = 4 to 7<BR>Attribute m. Memory attribute encoding for MPU regions with an AttrIndx of m.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>All See MAIR_ATTR for encoding.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
