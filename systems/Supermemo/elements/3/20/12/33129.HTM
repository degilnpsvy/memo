D1.2.158 MVFR1, Media and VFP Feature Register 1 
<P></P>
<P>The MVFR1 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Describes the features provided by the Floating-point Extension.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Floating-point Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Floating-point Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EF44.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MVFR1_NS located at 0xE002EF44. The location 0xE002EF44 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; When floating-point is not implemented this register reads as 0x00000000.<BR>&nbsp; Where single-precision only floating-point is supported this register reads as 0x11000011.<BR>&nbsp; Where single and double-precision floating-point are supported this register reads as 0x12000011.</P>
<P>The MVFR1 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>FMAC, bits [31:28]<BR>Fused multiply accumulate. Indicates whether the FP Extension implements the fused multiply accumulate instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>FPHP, bits [27:24]<BR>Floating-point half-precision. Indicates whether the FP Extension implements half-precision FP conversion instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Half-precision to single-precision implemented.<BR>0b0010 Half-precision to single and double-precision implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [23:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0. 
<P>FPDNaN, bits [7:4]<BR>Floating-point default NaN. Indicates whether the FP hardware implementation supports NaN propagation.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Propagation of NaN values supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001. 
<P>FPFtZ, bits [3:0]<BR>Floating-point flush-to-zero. Indicates whether subnormals are always flushed-to-zero.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Full denormalized numbers arithmetic supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.
