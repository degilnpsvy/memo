D1.2.151 MPU_RBAR_A&lt;n&gt;, MPU Region Base Address Register Alias, n = 1 - 3 
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_RBAR_A&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides indirect read and write access to the base address of the MPU region selected by MPU_RNR[7:2]:(n[1:0]) for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDA4 + 8(n-1).<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_RBAR_A&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002EDA4 + 8(n-1). The location 0xE002EDA4 + 8(n-1) is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; This register is an alias of the MPU_RBAR register and provides access to the configuration of the MPU region selected by MPU_RNR.REGION had REGION[1:0] been set to n[1:0].</P>
<P>The MPU_RBAR_A&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:</P>
<P>BASE, bits [31:5]<BR>Base address. Contains bits [31:5] of the lower inclusive limit of the selected MPU memory region. This value is zero extended to provide the base address to be checked against.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>SH, bits [4:3]<BR>Shareability. Defines the Shareability domain of this region for Normal memory.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00 Non-shareable.<BR>0b10 Outer Shareable.<BR>0b11 Inner Shareable.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>For any type of Device memory, the value of this field is ignored.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>AP[2:1], bits [2:1]<BR>Access permissions. Defines the access permissions for this region.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00 Read/write by privileged code only.<BR>0b01 Read/write by any privilege level.<BR>0b10 Read-only by privileged code only.<BR>0b11 Read-only by any privilege level.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>XN, bit [0]<BR>Execute Never. Defines whether code can be executed from this region.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Execution only permitted if read permitted.<BR>1 Execution not permitted.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
