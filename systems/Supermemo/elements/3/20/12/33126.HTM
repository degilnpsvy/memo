D1.2.154 MPU_RNR, MPU Region Number Register
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_RNR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Selects the region currently accessed by MPU_RBAR and MPU_RLAR.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED98.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_RNR_NS located at 0xE002ED98. The location 0xE002ED98 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The MPU_RNR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>REGION, bits [7:0]<BR>Region number. Indicates the memory region accessed by MPU_RBAR and MPU_RLAR.<BR>If no MPU regions are implemented, this field is RES0. Writing a value corresponding to an unimplemented region is CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
