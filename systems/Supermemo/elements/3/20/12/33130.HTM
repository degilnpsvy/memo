D1.2.159 MVFR2, Media and VFP Feature Register 2</P>
<P>The MVFR2 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Describes the features provided by the Floating-point Extension.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Floating-point Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Floating-point Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EF48.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MVFR2_NS located at 0xE002EF48. The location 0xE002EF48 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; When floating-point is not implemented this register reads as 0x00000000.<BR>&nbsp; When floating-point is implemented this register reads as 0x00000040.</P>
<P>The MVFR2 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>FPMisc, bits [7:4]<BR>Floating-point miscellaneous. Indicates support for miscellaneous FP features.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0100 Selection, directed conversion to integer, VMINNM and VMAXNM supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0100.</P>
<P>Bits [3:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
