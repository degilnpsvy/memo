D1.2.153 MPU_RLAR_A&lt;n&gt;, MPU Region Limit Address Register Alias, n = 1 - 3
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_RLAR_A&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides indirect read and write access to the limit address of the currently selected MPU region selected by MPU_RNR[7:2]:(n[1:0]) for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDA8 + 8(n-1).<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_RLAR_A&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002EDA8 + 8(n-1). The location 0xE002EDA8 + 8(n-1) is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; This register is an alias of the MPU_RLAR register and provides access to the configuration of the MPU region selected by MPU_RNR.REGION had REGION[1:0] been set to n[1:0].</P>
<P>The MPU_RLAR_A&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:</P>
<P>LIMIT, bits [31:5]<BR>Limit address. Contains bits [31:5] of the upper inclusive limit of the selected MPU memory region. This value is postfixed with 0x1F to provide the limit address to be checked against.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bit [4]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>AttrIndx, bits [3:1]<BR>Attribute index. Associates a set of attributes in the MPU_MAIR0 and MPU_MAIR1 fields.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>EN, bit [0]<BR>Enable. Region enable.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Region disabled.<BR>1 Region enabled.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
