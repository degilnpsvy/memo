D1.2.157 MVFR0, Media and VFP Feature Register 0</P>
<P>The MVFR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Describes the features provided by the Floating-point Extension.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Floating-point Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Floating-point Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EF40.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MVFR0_NS located at 0xE002EF40. The location 0xE002EF40 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; When floating-point is not implemented this register reads as 0x00000000.<BR>&nbsp; Where single-precision only floating-point is supported this register reads as 0x10110021.<BR>&nbsp; Where single and double-precision floating-point are supported this register reads as 0x10110221.</P>
<P>FPRound, bits [31:28]<BR>Floating-point rounding modes. Indicates the rounding modes supported by the FP Extension.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 All rounding modes supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>Bits [27:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>FPSqrt, bits [23:20]<BR>Floating-point square root. Indicates the support for FP square root operations.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>FPDivide, bits [19:16]<BR>Floating-point divide. Indicates the support for FP divide operations.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>Bits [15:12]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>FPDP, bits [11:8]<BR>Floating-point double-precision. Indicates support for FP double-precision operations.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 Not supported.<BR>0b0010 Supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>FPSP, bits [7:4]<BR>Floating-point single-precision. Indicates support for FP single-precision operations.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0010 Supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0010.</P>
<P>SIMDReg, bits [3:0]<BR>SIMD registers. Indicates size of FP register file.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 16 &#215; 64-bit registers.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.
