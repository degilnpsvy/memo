D1.2.152 MPU_RLAR, MPU Region Limit Address Register
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_RLAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides indirect read and write access to the limit address of the currently selected MPU region for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDA0.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_RLAR_NS located at 0xE002EDA0. The location 0xE002EDA0 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; This register provides access to the configuration of the MPU region selected by MPU_RNR.REGION for the appropriate Security state. The field descriptions apply to the currently selected region.</P>
<P>The MPU_RLAR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>LIMIT, bits [31:5]<BR>Limit address. Contains bits [31:5] of the upper inclusive limit of the selected MPU memory region. This value is postfixed with 0x1F to provide the limit address to be checked against.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bit [4]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>AttrIndx, bits [3:1]<BR>Attribute index. Associates a set of attributes in the MPU_MAIR0 and MPU_MAIR1 fields.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>EN, bit [0]<BR>Enable. Region enable.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Region disabled.<BR>1 Region enabled.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
