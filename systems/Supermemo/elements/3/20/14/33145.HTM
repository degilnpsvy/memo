D1.2.191 <FONT class=extract>SYST_RVR, SysTick Reload Value Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The SYST_RVR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>Provides access SysTick timer counter reload value for the selected Security state</FONT>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if at least one SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if no SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000E014.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SYST_RVR_NS located at 0xE002E014. The location 0xE002E014 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; <FONT class=extract>If the Main Extension is implemented, then two SysTick timers are implemented. If the Main Extension is not implemented, then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether none, one or two SysTick timers are implemented. Where two SysTick timers are implemented, this register is banked. Where one SysTick timer is implemented, this register is not banked, and Non-secure accesses behave as RAZ/WI if ICSR.STTNS is clear. If no SysTick timer is implemented, both aliases of this register behave as RES0.</FONT></P>
<P>The SYST_RVR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>RELOAD, bits [23:0]<BR>Counter reload value. The value to load into the SYST_CVR for the selected Security state when the counter reaches 0.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
