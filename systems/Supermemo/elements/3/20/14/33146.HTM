D1.2.192 TPIU_ACPR, TPIU Asynchronous Clock Prescaler Register</P>
<P>The TPIU_ACPR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Defines a prescaler value for the baud rate of the Serial Wire Output (SWO). Writing to the register automatically updates the prescale counter, immediately affecting the baud rate of the serial data output.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>&nbsp; If a debugger changes the register value while the TPIU is transmitting data, the effect on the output stream is UNPREDICTABLE and the required recovery process is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the TPIU is implemented and supports SWO.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the TPIU is not implemented or does not support SWO.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0040010.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The TPIU_ACPR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:16]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SWOSCALER, bits [15:0]<BR>SWO baud rate prescalar. Sets the ratio between an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED reference clock and the SWO output clock rates. The supported scaler value range is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED, to a maximum scalar value of 0xFFFF. Unused bits of this field are RAZ/WI.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>n SWO output clock = Asynchronous_Reference_Clock/(n + 1).<BR>This field resets to zero on a Cold reset.
