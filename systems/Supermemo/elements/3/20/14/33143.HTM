D1.2.189 <FONT class=extract>SYST_CSR, SysTick Control and Status Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The SYST_CSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Controls the SysTick timer and provides status data for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if at least one SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if no SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000E010.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SYST_CSR_NS located at 0xE002E010. The location 0xE002E010 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, then two SysTick timers are implemented. If the Main Extension is not implemented, then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether none, one or two SysTick timers are implemented. Where two SysTick timers are implemented, this register is banked. Where one SysTick timer is implemented, this register is not banked, and Non-secure accesses behave as RAZ/WI if ICSR.STTNS is clear. If no SysTick timer is implemented, both aliases of this register behave as RES0.</P>
<P>The SYST_CSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:17]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>COUNTFLAG, bit [16]<BR>Count flag. Indicates whether the counter has counted to zero since the last read of this register.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Timer has not counted to 0.<BR>1 Timer has counted to 0.<BR>COUNTFLAG is set to 1 by a count transition from 1 to 0. COUNTFLAG is cleared to 0 if software reads this bit as one, and by any write to the SYST_CVR for the selected Security state. Debugger reads do not clear the COUNTFLAG.<BR>If set this bit clears to zero when read by software. Reads from the debugger do not clear this bit.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P>Bits [15:3]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>CLKSOURCE, bit [2]<BR>Clock source. Indicates the SysTick clock source.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Uses the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED external reference clock.<BR>1 Uses the PE clock.<BR>If no external clock is implemented, this bit reads as 1 and ignores writes.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>TICKINT, bit [1]<BR>Tick interrupt. Indicates whether counting to 0 causes the status of the SysTick exception to change to pending.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Count to 0 does not affect the SysTick exception status.<BR>1 Count to 0 changes the SysTick exception status to pending.<BR>Changing the value of the counter to 0 by writing the SysTick does not change the status of the SysTick exception.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ENABLE, bit [0]<BR>SysTick enable. Indicates the enabled status of the SysTick counter.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Counter is disabled.<BR>1 Counter is enabled.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT>
