D1.2.190 SYST_CVR, SysTick Current Value Register</P>
<P>The SYST_CVR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Reads or clears the SysTick timer current counter value for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if at least one SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if no SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write-to-clear register located at 0xE000E018.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SYST_CVR_NS located at 0xE002E018. The location 0xE002E018 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, then two SysTick timers are implemented. If the Main Extension is not implemented, then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether none, one or two SysTick timers are implemented. Where two SysTick timers are implemented, this register is banked. Where one SysTick timer is implemented, this register is not banked, and Non-secure accesses behave as RAZ/WI if ICSR.STTNS is clear. If no SysTick timer is implemented, both aliases of this register behave as RES0.</P>
<P>The SYST_CVR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>CURRENT, bits [23:0], on a read<BR>Current counter value. Provides the value of the SysTick timer counter for the selected Security state.<BR>It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the current counter value decrements if the PE is sleeping and SCR.SLEEPDEEP is set.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>CURRENT, bits [23:0], on a write<BR>Reset counter value. Writing any value clears the SysTick timer counter for the selected Security state to zero.
