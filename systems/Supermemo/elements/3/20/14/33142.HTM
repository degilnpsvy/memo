D1.2.188 SYST_CALIB, SysTick Calibration Value Register</P>
<P>The SYST_CALIB characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Reads the SysTick timer calibration value and parameters for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if at least one SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if no SysTick timer is implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000E01C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SYST_CALIB_NS located at 0xE002E01C. The location 0xE002E01C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented then, two SysTick timers are implemented. If the Main Extension is not implemented, then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether none, one or two SysTick timers are implemented. Where two SysTick timers are implemented, this register is banked. Where one SysTick timer is implemented, this register is not banked, and Non-secure accesses behave as RAZ/WI if ICSR.STTNS is clear. If no SysTick timer is implemented, both aliases of this register behave as RES0.</P>
<P>The SYST_CALIB bit assignments are:</P>
<P>NOREF, bit [31]<BR>No reference. Indicates whether the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED reference clock is implemented.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Reference clock is implemented.<BR>1 Reference clock is not implemented.<BR>When this bit is 1, the CLKSOURCE bit of the SYST_CSR register is forced to 1 and cannot be cleared to 0.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>SKEW, bit [30]<BR>Skew. Indicates whether the 10ms calibration value is exact.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 TENMS calibration value is exact.<BR>1 TENMS calibration value is inexact.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [29:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>TENMS, bits [23:0]<BR>Ten milliseconds. Optionally, holds a reload value to be used for 10ms (100Hz) timing, subject to system clock skew errors. If this field is zero, the calibration value is not known.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this field is RES0.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
