D1.2.102 FP_REMAP, Flash Patch Remap Register
<P></P>
<P>The FP_REMAP characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Indicates whether the implementation supports Flash Patch remap and, if it does, holds the target address for remap.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the FPB is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0002004.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FP_REMAP bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:30]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>RMPSPT, bit [29]<BR>Remap supported. Indicates whether the FPB unit supports the Flash Patch remap function.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Flash Patch remap function is not implemented.<BR>1 Flash Patch remap function is implemented.<BR>Note<BR>The Flash Patch remap function must not be implemented if either the Main Extension is not implemented or the Security Extension is implemented.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>REMAP, bits [28:5]<BR>Remap address. Holds the bits[28:5] of the Flash Patch remap address.<BR>This field is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented, or if the Flash Patch remap function is not supported.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Cold reset.</P>
<P>Bits [4:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
