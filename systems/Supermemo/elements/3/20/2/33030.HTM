D1.2.110 ID_ISAR0, Instruction Set Attribute Register 0</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the instruction set implemented by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED60.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_ISAR0_NS located at 0xE002ED60. The location 0xE002ED60 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If coprocessors excluding the floating-point Extension are not supported this register reads as 0x01101110.<BR>&nbsp; If coprocessors excluding the floating-point Extension are supported this register reads as 0x01141110.</P>
