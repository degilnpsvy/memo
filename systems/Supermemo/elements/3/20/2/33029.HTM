D1.2.109 <FONT class=extract>ID_DFR0, Debug Feature Register 0</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The ID_DFR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides top level information about the debug system.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED48.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_DFR0_NS located at 0xE002ED48. The location 0xE002ED48 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If Halting debug is not implemented this register reads as 0x00000000.<BR>&nbsp; If Halting debug is implemented this register reads as 0x00200000.</P>
<P>The ID_DFR0 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>MProfDbg, bits [23:20]<BR>M-profile debug. Indicates the supported M-profile debug architecture.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>0b0010 ARMv8-M Debug architecture.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [19:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
