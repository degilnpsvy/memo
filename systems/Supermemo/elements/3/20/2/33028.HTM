D1.2.108 ID_AFR0, Auxiliary Feature Register 0 
<P></P>
<P>The ID_AFR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED features of the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED4C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_AFR0_NS located at 0xE002ED4C. The location 0xE002ED4C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ID_AFR0 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:16]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>IMPDEFm, bits [4m+3:4m], for m = 0 to 3<BR>IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED meaning.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
