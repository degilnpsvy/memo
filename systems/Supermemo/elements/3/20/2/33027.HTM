D1.2.107 ICTR, Interrupt Controller Type Register</P>
<P>The ICTR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the interrupt controller.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000E004.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ICTR_NS located at 0xE002E004. The location 0xE002E004 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ICTR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:4]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>INTLINESNUM, bits [3:0]<BR>Interrupt line set number. Indicates the number of the highest implemented register in each of the NVIC control register sets, or in the case of NVIC_IPRn, 4&#215;INTLINESNUM.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
