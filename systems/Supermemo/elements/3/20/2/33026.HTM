D1.2.105 ICIMVAU, Instruction Cache line Invalidate by Address to PoU
<P></P>
<P>The ICIMVAU characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Invalidate instruction cache line by address to PoU.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit write-only register located at 0xE000EF58.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ICIMVAU_NS located at 0xE002EF58. The location 0xE002EF58 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ICIMVAU bit assignments are:<BR>ADDRESS, bits [31:0]<BR>Address. Writing to this field initiates the maintenance operation for the address written.
