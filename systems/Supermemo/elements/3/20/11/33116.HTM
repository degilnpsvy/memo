D1.2.142 ITM_TPR, ITM Trace Privilege Register<BR>The ITM_TPR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Controls which stimulus ports can be accessed by unprivileged code.<BR>Usage constraints If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are<BR>permitted, but unprivileged writes are ignored.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0000E40.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The ITM_TPR bit assignments are:<BR>PRIVMASK, bits [31:0]<BR>Privilege mask. For PRIVMASK[m], defines the access permissions of stimulus ports<BR>ITM_STIM&lt;8m&gt; to ITM_STIM&lt;8m+7&gt; inclusive.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Unprivileged access permitted.<BR>1 Privileged access only.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented stimulus ports are RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Cold reset.
