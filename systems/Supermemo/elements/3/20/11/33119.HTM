D1.2.147 <FONT class=extract>MPU_CTRL, <FONT class=extract>MPU Control Register</FONT></FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The MPU_CTRL characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>Enables the MPU and, when the MPU is enabled, controls whether the default memory map is enabled as a background region for privileged accesses, and whether the MPU is enabled for HardFaults, NMIs, and exception handlers when FAULTMASK is set to 1.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED94.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MPU_CTRL_NS located at 0xE002ED94. The location 0xE002ED94 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The MPU_CTRL bit assignments are:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Bits [31:3]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>PRIVDEFENA, bit [2]<BR>Privileged default enable. Controls whether the default memory map is enabled for privileged software.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Use of default memory map disabled.<BR>1 Use of default memory map enabled for privilege code.<BR>When the ENABLE bit is set to 0, the PE ignores the PRIVDEFENA bit. If no regions are enabled and the PRIVDEFENA and ENABLE bits are set to 1, only privileged code can execute from the system address map. If no MPU regions are implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>HFNMIENA, bit [1]<BR>HardFault, NMI enable. Controls whether handlers executing with priority less than 0 access memory with the MPU enabled or disabled. This applies to HardFaults, NMIs, and exception handlers when FAULTMASK is set to 1.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 MPU disabled for these handlers.<BR>1 MPU enabled for these handlers.<BR>If HFNMIENA is set to 1 when ENABLE is set to 0, behavior is UNPREDICTABLE. If no MPU regions are implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>ENABLE, bit [0]<BR>Enable. Enables the MPU.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The MPU is disabled.<BR>1 The MPU is enabled.<BR>Disabling the MPU, by setting the ENABLE bit to 0, means that privileged and unprivileged accesses use the default memory map. If no MPU regions are implemented this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
