Adding a kobject to a kset is usually done when the object is created; it is a two-step process. The kobject&#8217;s kset field must be pointed at the kset of interest; then the kobject should be passed to: 
<P></P>
<P>int <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>(struct kobject *kobj); </P>
<P>As always, programmers should be aware that this function can fail (in which case it returns a negative error code) and respond accordingly.<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Birka; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Birka; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-hansi-font-family: Myriad-CnSemibold"><FONT face=Calibri> </FONT></SPAN>
