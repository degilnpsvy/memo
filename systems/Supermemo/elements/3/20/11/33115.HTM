D1.2.141 ITM_TER&lt;n&gt;, ITM Trace Enable Register, n = 0 - 7<BR>The ITM_TER&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provide an individual enable bit for each ITM_STIM register.<BR>Usage constraints If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are<BR>permitted.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0000E00 + 4n.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The ITM_TER&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:<BR>STIMENA, bits [31:0]<BR>Stimulus enable. For STIMENA[m] in ITM_TERn, controls whether ITM_STIM(32n + m) is<BR>enabled.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Stimulus port (32n + m) disabled.<BR>1 Stimulus port (32n + m) enabled.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented stimulus ports are RAZ/WI. Unprivileged writes to<BR>ITM_TERn do not update STIMENA[m] if ITM_TPR.PRIVMASK[(32n+m) DIV 8] is set to 1.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Cold reset.
