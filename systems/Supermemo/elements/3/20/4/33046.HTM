D1.2.127 ITM_DEVARCH, ITM Device Architecture Register</P>
<P>The ITM_DEVARCH characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the ITM.<BR>Usage constraints: If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are permitted.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0000FBC.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ITM_DEVARCH bit assignments are:</P>
<P>ARCHITECT, bits [31:21]<BR>Architect. Defines the architect of the component. Bits [31:28] are the JEP106 continuation code (JEP106 bank ID, minus 1) and bits [27:21] are the JEP106 ID code.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x23B JEP106 continuation code 0x4, ID code 0x3B. ARM Limited.<BR>Other values are defined by the JEDEC JEP106 standard.<BR>This field reads as 0x23B.</P>
<P>PRESENT, bit [20]<BR>DEVARCH Present. Defines that the DEVARCH register is present.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>1 DEVARCH information present.<BR>This bit reads as one.</P>
<P>REVISION, bits [19:16]<BR>Revision. Defines the architecture revision of the component.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 ITM architecture v2.0.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.</P>
<P>ARCHVER, bits [15:12]<BR>Architecture Version. Defines the architecture version of the component.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 ITM architecture v2.<BR>ARCHVER and ARCHPART are also defined as a single field, ARCHID, such that ARCHVER is</P>
<P>ARCHID[15:12].<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>ARCHPART, bits [11:0]<BR>Architecture Part. Defines the architecture of the component.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0xA01 ITM architecture.<BR>ARCHVER and ARCHPART are also defined as a single field, ARCHID, such that ARCHPART is</P>
<P>ARCHID[11:0].<BR>This field reads as 0xA01.
