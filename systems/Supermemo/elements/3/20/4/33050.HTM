D1.2.131 ITM_PIDR0, ITM Peripheral Identification Register 0</P>
<P>The ITM_PIDR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provides CoreSight discovery information for the ITM.<BR>Usage constraints If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are<BR>permitted.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0000FE0.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The ITM_PIDR0 bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>PART_0, bits [7:0]<BR>Part number bits [7:0]. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
