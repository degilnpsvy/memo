D1.2.128 ITM_DEVTYPE, ITM Device Type Register
<P></P>
<P>The ITM_DEVTYPE characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the ITM.<BR>Usage constraints: If the Main Extension is implemented, both privileged and unprivileged accesses are permitted.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the ITM is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the ITM is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then the ITM is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0000FCC.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ITM_DEVTYPE bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SUB, bits [7:4]<BR>Subtype. Component subtype.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x0 Other. Only permitted if the MAJOR field reads as 0x0.<BR>0x4 Associated with a Bus, stimulus derived from bus activity. Only permitted if the MAJOR field reads as 0x3.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>MAJOR, bits [3:0]<BR>Major type. Component major type.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x0 Miscellaneous.<BR>0x3 Trace Source.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
