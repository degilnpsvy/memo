D1.2.121 ID_PFR1, Processor Feature Register 1
<P></P>
<P>The ID_PFR1 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Gives information about the programmers' model and Extensions support.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED44.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_PFR1_NS located at 0xE002ED44. The location 0xE002ED44 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If the Security Extension is not implemented this register reads as 0x00000200.<BR>&nbsp; If the Security Extension is implemented this register reads as 0x00000210.</P>
<P>The ID_PFR1 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:12]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>MProgMod, bits [11:8]<BR>M programmers' model. Identifies support for the M-Profile programmers' model support.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0010 Two-stack programmers' model.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0010.</P>
<P>Security, bits [7:4]<BR>Security. Identifies whether the Security Extension is implemented.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 Security Extension not implemented.<BR>0b0001 Security Extension implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [3:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
