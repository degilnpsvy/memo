CLRPEND, bits [31:0], on a read<BR>Clear pending. For CLRPEND[m] in NVIC_ICPRn, indicates whether interrupt 32n + m is pending.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt 32n + m is not pending.<BR>1 Interrupt 32n + m is pending.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.
