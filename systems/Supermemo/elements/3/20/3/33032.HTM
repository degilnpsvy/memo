D1.2.112 ID_ISAR2, Instruction Set Attribute Register 2</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR2 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the instruction set implemented by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED68.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_ISAR2_NS located at 0xE002ED68. The location 0xE002ED68 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; With bits [11:8] masked, if the DSP Extension is not implemented, this register reads as 0x20112032.<BR>&nbsp; With bits[11:8] masked, if the DSP Extension is implemented, this register reads as 0x20232032.<BR>&nbsp; The value of bits [11:8] is determined by whether the PE implements restartable or continuable multi-access instructions.</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR2 bit assignments are:</P>
