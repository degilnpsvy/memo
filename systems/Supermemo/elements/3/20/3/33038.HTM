D1.2.118 ID_MMFR2, Memory Model Feature Register 2 
<P></P>
<P>The ID_MMFR2 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the implemented memory model and memory management support.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED58.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_MMFR2_NS located at 0xE002ED58. The location 0xE002ED58 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ID_MMFR2 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:28]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>WFIStall, bits [27:24]<BR>WFI stall. Indicates the support for Wait For Interrupt (WFI) stalling.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 WFI never stalls.<BR>0b0001 WFI has the ability to stall.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [23:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
