D1.2.116 ID_MMFR0, Memory Model Feature Register 0 
<P></P>
<P>The ID_MMFR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the implemented memory model and memory management support.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED50.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_MMFR0_NS located at 0xE002ED50. The location 0xE002ED50 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
