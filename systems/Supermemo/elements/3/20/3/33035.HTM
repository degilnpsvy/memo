D1.2.115 ID_ISAR5, Instruction Set Attribute Register 5</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR5 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the instruction set implemented by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED74.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_ISAR5_NS located at 0xE002ED74. The location 0xE002ED74 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR5 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
