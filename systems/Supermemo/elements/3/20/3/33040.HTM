D1.2.120 ID_PFR0, Processor Feature Register 0</P>
<P>The ID_PFR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Gives top-level information about the instruction set supported by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED40.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_PFR0_NS located at 0xE002ED40. The location 0xE002ED40 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; This register reads as 0x00000030.</P>
<P>The ID_PFR0 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>State1, bits [7:4]<BR>State one. T32 instruction set support.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0011 T32 instruction set including Thumb-2 Technology implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0011.</P>
<P>State0, bits [3:0]<BR>State two. A32 instruction set support.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 A32 instruction set not implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.
