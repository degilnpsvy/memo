D1.2.111 ID_ISAR1, Instruction Set Attribute Register 1</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR1 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the instruction set implemented by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED64.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_ISAR1_NS located at 0xE002ED64. The location 0xE002ED64 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If the DSP Extension is not implemented, this register reads as 0x02211000.<BR>&nbsp; If the DSP Extension is implemented, this register reads as 0x02212000.</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR1 bit assignments are:</P>

<P>Immediate, bits [23:20]<BR>Immediate. Indicates the implemented for data-processing instructions with long immediates.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0010 ADDW, MOVW, MOVT, and SUBW supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0010.</P>
<P>IfThen, bits [19:16]<BR>If-Then. Indicates the implemented If-Then instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 IT instruction supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>Extend, bits [15:12]<BR>Extend. Indicates the implemented Extend instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 SXTB, SXTH, UXTB, and UXTH.<BR>0b0010 Adds SXTB16, SXTAB, SXTAB16, SXTAH, UXTB16, UXTAB, UXTAB16, and UXTAH, DSP Extension only.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Bits [11:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
