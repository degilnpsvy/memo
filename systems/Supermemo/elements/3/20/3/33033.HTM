D1.2.113 ID_ISAR3, Instruction Set Attribute Register 3</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR3 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the instruction set implemented by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED6C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_ISAR3_NS located at 0xE002ED6C. The location 0xE002ED6C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; If the DSP Extension is not implemented, this register reads as 0x01111110.<BR>&nbsp; If the DSP Extension is implemented, this register reads as 0x01111131.</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR3 bit assignments are:</P>

<P>T32Copy, bits [23:20]<BR>T32 copy. Indicates the support for T32 non flag-setting MOV instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 Encoding T1 of MOV (register) supports copying low register to low register.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>TabBranch, bits [19:16]<BR>Table branch. Indicates the implemented Table Branch instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 TBB and TBH implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
