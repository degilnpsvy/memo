D1.2.114 ID_ISAR4, Instruction Set Attribute Register 4
<P></P>
<P>The ID_ISAR4 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the instruction set implemented by the PE.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED70.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_ISAR4_NS located at 0xE002ED70. The location 0xE002ED70 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Preface<BR>&nbsp; This register reads as 0x01310131.</P>
<P>The ID_ISAR4 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:28]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>PSR_M, bits [27:24]<BR>Program Status Registers M. Indicates the implemented M profile instructions to modify the PSRs.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 M profile forms of CPS, MRS, and MSR implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>SyncPrim_frac, bits [23:20]<BR>Synchronization primitives fractional. Used in conjunction with ID_ISAR3.SynchPrim to indicate the implemented Synchronization Primitive instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0011 LDREX, STREX, CLREX, LDREXB, LDREXH, STREXB, and STREXH<BR>implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0011.</P>
<P>Barrier, bits [19:16]<BR>Barrier. Indicates the implemented Barrier instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 DMB, DSB, and ISB barrier instructions implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.<BR>Bits [15:12]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>Writeback, bits [11:8]<BR>Writeback. Indicates the support for writeback addressing modes.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0001 All writeback addressing modes supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0001.</P>
<P>WithShifts, bits [7:4]<BR>With shifts. Indicates the support for writeback addressing modes.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0011 Support for constant shifts on load/store and other instructions.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0011.</P>
<P>Unpriv, bits [3:0]<BR>Unprivileged. Indicates the implemented unprivileged instructions.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0010 LDRBT, LDRHT, LDRSBT, LDRSHT, LDRT, STRBT, STRHT, and STRT implemented.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as 0b0010.
