D1.2.119 ID_MMFR3, Memory Model Feature Register 3
<P></P>
<P>The ID_MMFR3 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides information about the implemented memory model and memory management support.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED5C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via ID_MMFR3_NS located at 0xE002ED5C. The location 0xE002ED5C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The ID_MMFR3 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:12]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>BPMaint, bits [11:8]<BR>Branch predictor maintenance. Indicates the supported branch predictor maintenance.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 None supported.<BR>0b0001 Support for invalidate all of branch predictors.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>CMaintSW, bits [7:4]<BR>Cache maintenance set/way. Indicates the supported cache maintenance operations by set/way.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 None supported.<BR>0b0001 Maintenance by set/way operations supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>CMaintVA, bits [3:0]<BR>Cache maintenance by address. Indicates the supported cache maintenance operations by address.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 None supported.<BR>0b0001 Maintenance by address and instruction cache invalidate all supported.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
