7.3 Chaining of TBs:</P>
<P>Returning from the code cache to the static code (QEMU code) and jumping back into the code cache is generally slow. To solve this QEMU chains every TB to the next TB. So after the execution of one TB the execution directly jumps to the next TB without returning to the static code. The chaining of block happens when the Tb returns to the static code. Thus when TB1 returns (as there was no chaining) to static code the next TB, TB2, is found, generated and executed. When TB2 returns it is immediately chained to TB1. This makes sure that next time when TB1 is executed TB2 follows it without returning to the static code. Figure 7.8 (a-c) in the following page illustrates chaining of TBs.
