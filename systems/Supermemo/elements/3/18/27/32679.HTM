For QEMU the emulated architectures is called the Target. And the real machine on which QEMU is running, emulating the target, is called the Host. The dynamic translation of virtual machine (target ) code to Host code is done by a module in QEMU called the Tiny Code Generator or TCG for short. When it comes to TCG the term &#8216;target&#8217; gets a different meaning. TCG creates the code to emulate the target thus the code created by TCG is called its target .Thus when it comes to TCG target means the generated Host code.
