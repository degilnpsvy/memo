The DHCSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EDF0.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DHCSR_NS located at 0xE002EDF0. The location 0xE002EDF0 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.
