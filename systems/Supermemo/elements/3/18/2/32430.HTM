<DIV class=warning>
<P><CODE class=literal>G_CONST_RETURN</CODE> has been deprecated since version 2.30 and should not be used in newly-written code.</P>
<P>API providers should replace all existing uses with const and API consumers should adjust their code accordingly</P></DIV>
<P>If <CODE class=literal>G_DISABLE_CONST_RETURNS</CODE> is defined, this macro expands to nothing. By default, the macro expands to const. The macro can be used in place of const for functions that return a value that should not be modified. The purpose of this macro is to allow us to turn on const for returned constant strings by default, while allowing programmers who find that annoying to turn it off. This macro should only be used for return values and for "out" parameters, it doesn't make sense for "in" parameters.</P></DIV>
