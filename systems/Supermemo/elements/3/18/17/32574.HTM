Purpose: For each group of 32 interrupts, shows the active state of each interrupt.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000E300 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via NVIC_IABR&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002E300 + 4n. The location 0xE002E300 + 4n is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.
