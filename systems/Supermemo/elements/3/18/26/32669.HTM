To perform some tasks, you may find it easier to switch back temporarily to the mode you're used to. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> moves you back to the mode you were in before you entered picture mode. Make any necessary changes, then enter picture mode again by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>picture-mode</SPAN>.
