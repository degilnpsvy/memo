<P class=docText><FONT class=extract>Picture mode makes some </FONT><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2377></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2378></A><FONT class=extract>small but important changes in the basic cursor commands. There's an easy way to summarize these changes: in picture mode the buffer becomes a grid of rows and columns. For example, consider what <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> does in most other modes: it moves forward through the file, one character at a time. Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> repeatedly moves the cursor to the left, then at the end of the line, it jumps to the first character on the next line. picture mode, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> means "move to the right." When you reach the end of the line in picture mode, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> doesn't wrap to the next line; it continues adding characters to the current line.</FONT></P>
<P class=docText><SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-n</SPAN> become vertical "up" and "down" commands, respectively. Try editing some sample text, moving to the end of a line, and typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN>. Normally, as you type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN>, the cursor stays at the end of the line; if the previous line is short, the cursor moves to the left when it goes up. In picture mode, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-n</SPAN> always move up (or down) in a straight line.</P>
<P class=docText>You can get to every place you need to go with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-b</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-p</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-n</SPAN>. The arrow keys work too, but you may want to know the cursor movement commands for moving in the default direction as well, so you can also go sideways when it's faster. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> moves you forward in the default direction (so "forward" here could mean to the left, right, up, or down, as well as all directions in between). <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-b</SPAN> moves you backward in the default direction. (Moving "up" or "down" relative to the default direction isn't defined.)</P>
<P class=docText>For example, let's say you had drawn the house shown in <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-7-sect-4.html#gnu3-chp-7-fig-1">Figure 7-1</A> and you wanted to move the cursor down the left side of the roof. You would set the default direction to "southwest" by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>/</SPAN>. If the cursor were on the top shingle on the left side of the roof, typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> would move you down the left side of the roof and typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> would move you to the top-right shingle, as shown in <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-7-sect-6.html#gnu3-chp-7-fig-5">Figure 7-5</A>.</P><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-FIG-5></A>
