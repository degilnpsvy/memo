Tabs are also different in <A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2389></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2390></A>picture mode. By default, picture mode interprets the following characters as tab stops if they appear by themselves on a line: exclamation point (!), hyphen (-) and tilde (~). If these characters appear on a line and the user presses tab on the next line, these characters are presumed to denote tab stops. You can change this behavior by setting the variable <SPAN class=docEmphBold>picture-tab-chars</SPAN> to other characters. If the characters appear with normal text, they are not interpreted as tab stops. To use these characters as tab stops, press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Esc-Tab</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>picture-tab-search</SPAN>).
