<P class=docText>One of the more difficult things to do in <A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2381></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2382></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2383></A>picture mode is to type a standard carriage return that breaks a line in the middle. You can move to a point in the middle of a line, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-k</SPAN> to kill the right-hand portion, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-o</SPAN> to insert a blank line; type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN> to move to the beginning of this blank line, and type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-y</SPAN> to yank the right-hand part of the line back. Or you can use the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>split-line</SPAN> command (<SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-M-o</SPAN>), and then delete the blank space at the beginning of the new line.
