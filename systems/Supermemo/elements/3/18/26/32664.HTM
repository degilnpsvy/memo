Picture mode makes some <A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2377></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2378></A>small but important changes in the basic cursor commands. There's an easy way to summarize these changes: in picture mode the buffer becomes a grid of rows and columns. For example, consider what <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> does in most other modes: it moves forward through the file, one character at a time. Typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> repeatedly moves the cursor to the left, then at the end of the line, it jumps to the first character on the next line. picture mode, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> means "move to the right." When you reach the end of the line in picture mode, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-f</SPAN> doesn't wrap to the next line; it continues adding characters to the current line.
