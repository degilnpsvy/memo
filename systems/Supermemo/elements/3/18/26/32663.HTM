Picture mode tries to make these commands easy to remember, and it doesn't do too badly: for example, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>^</SPAN> points upward, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c-`</SPAN> arguably points to the northwest, and so on. If you can come up with a good mnemonic device for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> . let us know! Maybe you can think of it as "dot for down."
