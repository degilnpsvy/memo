Deletion isn't quite the<A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2384></A><A name=gnu3-CHP-7-ITERM-2385></A> same, either. In picture mode <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN> is the delete character command that you're used to: it deletes the character under the cursor and moves the rest of the line to the left. An unadorned <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-d</SPAN> deletes the character under the cursor, replacing it with a space. <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Del</SPAN> deletes the character to the left of the cursor, replacing it with a space.
