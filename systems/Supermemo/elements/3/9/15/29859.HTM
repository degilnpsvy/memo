The pseudocode hierarchy for a load or store instruction is as follows:<BR>&#8226; the instruction operation uses the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> helper function<BR>&#8226; memory attributes are determined from the default system address map or using an MPU as defined in The system address map on page B3-704 or Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7 on page B3-761 respectively.<BR>&#8226; the access is governed by whether the access is a read or write, its address alignment, data endianness and memory attributes.
