The pseudocode hierarchy for a load or store instruction is as follows:<BR>&#8226; the instruction operation uses the <FONT class=clozed>MemA[] or MemU[]</FONT> helper function<BR>&#8226; memory attributes are determined from <FONT class=clozed>the default system address map or using an MPU as defined in The system address map on page B3-704 or Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7 on page B3-761 respectively</FONT>.<BR>&#8226; the access is governed by <FONT class=clozed>whether the access is a read or write, its address alignment, data endianness and memory attributes</FONT>.
