The IsExclusiveLocal() function takes as arguments an address, the processor identifier processorid and the size of the transfer. 
<P></P>
<P>The function returns TRUE if the processor processorid has marked an address range as exclusive access requested that covers at least the size bytes from the address. </P>
<P>It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this function returns TRUE or FALSE if <FONT class=clozed>the address marked as exclusive access requested does not cover all of the size bytes from the address</FONT>. </P>
<P>If no address is marked as exclusive access requested, then this function returns FALSE. </P>
<P>It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this result is ANDed with the result of IsExclusiveGlobal() with the same parameters.</P>
