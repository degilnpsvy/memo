The IsExclusiveLocal() function takes as arguments an address, the processor identifier processorid and the size of the transfer. The function returns TRUE if the processor processorid has marked an address range as exclusive access requested that covers at least the size bytes from the address. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this function returns TRUE or FALSE if the address marked as exclusive access requested does not cover all of the size bytes from the address. If no address is marked as exclusive access requested, then this function returns FALSE. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this result is ANDed with the result of IsExclusiveGlobal() with the same parameters.</P>
