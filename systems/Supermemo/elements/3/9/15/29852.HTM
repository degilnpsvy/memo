The ClearExclusiveByAddress() procedure takes as arguments an address, the processor identifier processorid and the size of the transfer. The procedure clears the global records of all processors, other than processorid, for which an address region including any of the size bytes starting from the supplied address has had a request for an exclusive access. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the equivalent global record of the processor processorid is also cleared if any of the size bytes starting from the address has had a request for an exclusive access, or if any other address has had a request for an exclusive access.
