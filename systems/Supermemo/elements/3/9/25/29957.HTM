Following constraints are x86 specific. </P>
<P></P>
<OL>
<LI>"r" : Register operand constraint, look table given above. 
<LI>"q" : Registers a, b, c or d. 
<LI>"I" : Constant in range 0 to 31 (for 32-bit shifts). 
<LI>"J" : Constant in range 0 to 63 (for 64-bit shifts). 
<LI>"K" : 0xff. 
<LI>"L" : 0xffff. 
<LI>"M" : 0, 1, 2, or 3 (shifts for lea instruction). 
<LI>"N" : Constant in range 0 to 255 (for out instruction). 
<LI>"f" : Floating point register 
<LI>"t" : First (top of stack) floating point register 
<LI>"u" : Second floating point register 
<LI>"A" : Specifies the `a&#8217; or `d&#8217; registers. This is primarily useful for 64-bit integer values intended to be returned with the `d&#8217; register holding the most significant bits and the `a&#8217; register holding the least significant bits.</LI></OL>
