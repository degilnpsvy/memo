Some other constraints used are: </P>
<OL>
<LI>"m" : A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine supports in general. 
<LI>"o" : A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is offsettable. ie, adding a small offset to the address gives a valid address. 
<LI>"V" : A memory operand that is not offsettable. In other words, anything that would fit the `m&#8217; constraint but not the `o&#8217;constraint. 
<LI>"i" : An immediate integer operand (one with constant value) is allowed. This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at assembly time. 
<LI>"n" : An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed. Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less than a word wide. Constraints for these operands should use &#8217;n&#8217; rather than &#8217;i&#8217;. 
<LI>"g" : Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for registers that are not general registers.</LI></OL>
