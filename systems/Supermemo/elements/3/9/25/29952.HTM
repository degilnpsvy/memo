If our assembly statement must execute where we put it, (i.e. must not be moved out of a loop as an optimization), put the keyword <FONT class=clozed><CODE>volatile</CODE> after asm and before the ()&#8217;s. So to keep it from moving, deleting and all, we declare it as </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><CODE><FONT class=clozed>asm volatile ( ... : ... : ... : ...);</FONT></CODE>
