The cacheability attributes for a region are independent of the shareability attributes for the region. The cacheability attributes indicate the required handling of the data region if it is used for purposes other than the handling of shared data. This independence means that, for example, <FONT class=clozed>a region of memory that is marked as being cacheable and Shareable might not be held in the cache in an implementation where Shareable regions do not cache their data</FONT>.
