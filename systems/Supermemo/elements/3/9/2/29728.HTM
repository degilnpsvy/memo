tag the pointer to the RCU-protected data structure with __rcu, and sparse will warn you if you access that pointer without the services of one of the variants of rcu_dereference(). 
<P></P>
<P>rcu_dereference() returns a pointer that can be safely dereferenced by the code and documents the programmer's intention to protect the pointer with the RCU mechanism, enabling tools like Sparse to check for programming errors and omissions.
