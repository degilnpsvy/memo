A7.2 Standard assembler <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> 
<P></P>
<P>The following assembler <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> are standard across all or most instructions:</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>&lt;c&gt; Is an optional field. It specifies the condition under which the instruction is executed. If &lt;c&gt; is omitted, it defaults to always (AL). For details see Conditional instructions on page A4-126.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>&lt;q&gt; Specifies optional assembler qualifiers on the instruction. The following qualifiers are defined:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .N Meaning narrow, specifies that the assembler must select a 16-bit encoding for the instruction. If this is not possible, an assembler error is produced.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .W Meaning wide, specifies that the assembler must select a 32-bit encoding for the instruction. If this is not possible, an assembler error is produced.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If neither .W nor .N is specified, the assembler can select either 16-bit or 32-bit encodings. If both are available, it must select a 16-bit encoding. In a few cases, more than one encoding of the same length can be available for an instruction. The rules for selecting between such encodings are instruction-specific and are part of the instruction description.</FONT>
