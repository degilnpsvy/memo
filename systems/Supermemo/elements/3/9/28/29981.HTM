This means that adding a small integer (actually, the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory address. </FONT>
<P><A name=index-autoincrement_002fdecrement-addressing-3666></A><FONT class=extract>For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement address is not offsettable. More complicated indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other addressing modes that the machine supports. </FONT></P>

<DD><FONT class=extract>An immediate integer operand whose value is not an explicit integer is allowed. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=extract>This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known value. So why use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>s</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; instead of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>i</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;? Sometimes it allows better code to be generated. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between &#8722;128 and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and using the register. This is because the load into the register can be done with a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>moveq</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; instruction. We arrange for this to happen by defining the letter &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>K</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; to mean &#8220;any integer outside the range &#8722;128 to 127&#8221;, and then specifying &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>Ks</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the operand constraints.</FONT> </P>

<DD><FONT class=extract>An operand that matches the specified operand number is allowed. If a digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the digit should come last. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=extract>This number is allowed to be more than a single digit. If multiple digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a single decimal integer. There is scant chance for ambiguity, since to-date it has never been desirable that &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>10</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; be interpreted as matching either operand 1 <EM>or</EM> operand 0. Should this be desired, one can use multiple alternatives instead. </FONT></P>
<P><A name=index-matching-constraint-3685></A><A name=index-constraint_002c-matching-3686></A><FONT class=extract>This is called a <DFN>matching constraint</DFN> and what it really means is that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles which <CODE>asm</CODE> distinguishes. For example, an add instruction uses two input operands and an output operand, but on most CISC machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an input-output operand: </FONT></P><PRE class=smallexample><FONT class=extract>          addl #35,r12
</FONT></PRE>
<P><FONT class=extract>Matching constraints are used in these circumstances. More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only operand and one output-only operand.
