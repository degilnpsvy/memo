B2.1 About the system memory model</P>
<P>The pseudocode described in this chapter is associated with instruction fetches from memory and load or store data accesses.<BR>The pseudocode hierarchy for a load or store instruction is as follows:<BR>&#8226; the instruction operation uses the MemA[] or MemU[] helper function<BR>&#8226; memory attributes are determined from the default system address map or using an MPU as defined in The system address map on page B3-704 or Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7 on page B3-761 respectively.<BR>&#8226; the access is governed by whether the access is a read or write, its address alignment, data endianness and memory attributes.
