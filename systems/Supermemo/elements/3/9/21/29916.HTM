Conditional instructions 
<P></P>
<P>For maximum portability of UAL assembly language between the A32 and T32 instruction sets, ARM recommends that:<BR>&#8226; IT instructions are written before conditional instructions in the correct way for the T32 instruction set.<BR>&#8226; When assembling to the A32 instruction set, assemblers check that any IT instructions are correct, but do not generate any code for them.</P>
<P>Although other T32 instructions are unconditional, all instructions that are made conditional by an IT instruction must be written with a condition. These conditions must match the conditions imposed by the IT instruction. For example, an ITTEE EQ instruction imposes the EQ condition on the first two following instructions, and the NE condition on the next two. Those four instructions must be written with EQ, EQ, NE and NE conditions respectively.<BR>Some instructions cannot be made conditional by an IT instruction. Some instructions can be conditional if they are the last instruction in the IT block, but not otherwise.<BR><FONT class=extract>The branch instruction encodings that include a condition field cannot be made conditional by an IT instruction. If the assembler syntax indicates a conditional branch that correctly matches a preceding IT instruction, it is assembled using a branch instruction encoding that does not include a condition field.</FONT>
