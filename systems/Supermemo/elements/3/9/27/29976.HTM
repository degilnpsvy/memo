If our instruction modifies memory in an unpredictable fashion, add "<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>" to the list of clobbered registers. This will cause GCC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the assembler instruction. We also have to add the <B>volatile</B> keyword if the memory affected is not listed in the inputs or outputs of the asm.
