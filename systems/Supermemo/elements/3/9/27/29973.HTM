Several kernel functions return pointer values. Whereas callers usually check for failure by comparing the return value with <TT>NULL</TT><A name="decipher the"></A>, they typically need more information to decipher the exact nature of the error that has occurred. Because <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, they can be overloaded to encode error semantics. This is done with the help of a set of helper routines.
