Part B<BR>The system level programming model and system level support instructions required for system correctness. The system level supports the ARMv7-M exception model. It also provides features for configuration and control of processor resources and management of memory access rights.<BR>This is the information in addition to Part A required for an operating system (OS) and/or system support software. It includes details of register banking, the exception model, memory protection (management of access rights) and cache support.<BR>Part B is profile specific. ARMv7-M introduces a new programmers&#8217; model and as such has some fundamental differences at the system level from the other profiles. As ARMv7-M is a memory-mapped architecture, the system memory map is documented here.
