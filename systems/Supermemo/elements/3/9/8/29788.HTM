Part A<BR>The application level programming model and memory model information along with the instruction set as visible to the application programmer.<BR>This is the information required to program applications or to develop the toolchain components (compiler, linker, assembler and disassembler) excluding the debugger. For ARMv7-M, this is almost entirely a subset of material common to the other two profiles. Instruction set details that differ between profiles are clearly stated.<BR>Note<BR>All ARMv7 profiles support a common procedure calling standard, the <FONT class=clozed>ARM Architecture Procedure Calling Standard (AAPCS)</FONT>.
