&nbsp;* A bus is a channel between the processor and one or more devices. For the<BR>&nbsp;* purposes of the device model, all devices are connected via a bus, even if<BR>&nbsp;* it is an internal, virtual, "platform" bus. Buses can plug into each other.<BR>&nbsp;* A USB controller is usually a PCI device, for example. The device model<BR>&nbsp;* represents the actual connections between buses and the devices they control.<BR>&nbsp;* A bus is represented by the <FONT class=clozed>bus_type</FONT> structure. It contains the name, the<BR>&nbsp;* default attributes, the bus' methods, PM operations, and the driver core's<BR>&nbsp;* private data.
