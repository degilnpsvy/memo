<P>Load data at the guest address t1 into t0, or store data in t0 at guest address t1. The _i32/_i64 size applies to the size of the input/output register t0 only. The address t1 is always sized according to the guest, and the width of the memory operation is controlled by flags. </P>
<P>Both t0 and t1 may be split into little-endian ordered pairs of registers if dealing with 64-bit quantities on a 32-bit host. </P>
<P>The memidx selects the qemu tlb index to use (e.g. user or kernel access). The flags are the TCGMemOp bits, selecting the sign, width, and endianness of the memory access. </P>
<P>For a 32-bit host, qemu_ld/st_i64 is guaranteed to only be used with a 64-bit memory access specified in flags.
