to provide an interface for iterating over a list<BR>&nbsp;* that is safe and allows for modification of the list during the<BR>&nbsp;* iteration (e.g. insertion and removal), including modification of the<BR>&nbsp;* current node on the list.<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* It works using a 3rd object type - struct klist_iter - that is declared<BR>&nbsp;* and initialized before an iteration. klist_next() is used to acquire the<BR>&nbsp;* next element in the list. It returns NULL if there are no more items.<BR>&nbsp;* Internally, that routine takes the klist's lock, decrements the<BR>&nbsp;* reference count of the previous klist_node and increments the count of<BR>&nbsp;* the next klist_node. It then drops the lock and returns.
