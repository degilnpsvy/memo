&nbsp;* This is the first part of the device unregistration<BR>&nbsp;* sequence. This removes the device from the lists we control<BR>&nbsp;* from here, has it removed from the other driver model<BR>&nbsp;* subsystems it was added to in device_add(), and removes it<BR>&nbsp;* from the kobject hierarchy.<BR>&nbsp;*<BR>&nbsp;* NOTE: this should be called manually _iff_ device_add() was<BR>&nbsp;* also called manually.
