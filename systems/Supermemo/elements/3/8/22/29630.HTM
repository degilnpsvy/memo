The device structure contains the information that the device model core needs to model the system. Most subsystems, however, track additional information about the devices they host. As a result, it is rare for devices to be represented by bare device structures; instead, that structure, like kobject structures, is usually embedded within a higher-level representation of the device. If you look at the definitions of struct pci_dev or struct usb_device, you will find a struct device buried inside. Usually, low-level drivers are not even aware of that struct device, but there can be exceptions.</FONT>
