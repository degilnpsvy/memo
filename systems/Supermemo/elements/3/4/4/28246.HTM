A5.1.1 UNDEFINED and UNPREDICTABLE instruction set space 
<P></P>
<P>An attempt to execute an unallocated instruction results in either:<BR>&#8226; Unpredictable behavior. The instruction is described as UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&#8226; An Undefined Instruction exception. The instruction is described as UNDEFINED.</P>
<P>An instruction is UNDEFINED if it is declared as UNDEFINED in an instruction description, or in this chapter</P>
<P>An instruction is UNPREDICTABLE if:<BR>&#8226; a bit marked (0) or (1) in the encoding diagram of an instruction is not 0 or 1 respectively, and the pseudocode for that encoding does not indicate that a different special case applies<BR>&#8226; it is declared as UNPREDICTABLE in an instruction description or in this chapter.</P>
<P>Unless otherwise specified:<BR>&#8226; Thumb instructions introduced in an architecture variant are either UNPREDICTABLE or UNDEFINED in earlier architecture variants.<BR>&#8226; A Thumb instruction that is provided by one or more of the architecture extensions is either UNPREDICTABLE or UNDEFINED in an implementation that does not include those extensions.</P>
<P>In both cases, the instruction is UNPREDICTABLE if it is a 32-bit instruction in an architecture variant before ARMv6T2, and UNDEFINED otherwise.
