The model for the use of a Load-Exclusive/Store-Exclusive instruction pair, accessing memory address x is:<BR>&#8226; The Load-Exclusive instruction always successfully reads a value from memory address x<BR>&#8226; The corresponding Store-Exclusive instruction succeeds in writing back to memory address x only if no other processor or process has performed a more recent store of address x. The Store-Exclusive operation returns a status bit that indicates whether the memory write succeeded. 
<P></P>
<P>A Load-Exclusive instruction tags a small block of memory for exclusive access. The size of the taggedblock is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED, see Tagging and the size of the tagged memory block on page A3-96. A Store-Exclusive instruction to the same address clears the tag.
