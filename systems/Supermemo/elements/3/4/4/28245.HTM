A5.1 Thumb instruction set encoding
<P></P>
<P>The Thumb instruction stream is a sequence of halfword-aligned halfwords. Each Thumb instruction is either a single 16-bit halfword in that stream, or a 32-bit instruction consisting of two consecutive halfwords in that stream.</P>
<P>If bits [15:11] of the halfword being decoded take any of the following values, the halfword is the first halfword of a 32-bit instruction:<BR>&#8226; 0b11101<BR>&#8226; 0b11110<BR>&#8226; 0b11111.<BR>Otherwise, the halfword is a 16-bit instruction.</P>
<P>See 16-bit Thumb instruction encoding on page A5-156 for details of the encoding of 16-bit Thumb instructions.</P>
<P>See 32-bit Thumb instruction encoding on page A5-164 for details of the encoding of 32-bit Thumb instructions.
