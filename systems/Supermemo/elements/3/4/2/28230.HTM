dev/ contains two directories char/ and block/. Inside these two<BR>directories there are symlinks named &lt;major&gt;:&lt;minor&gt;.&nbsp; These symlinks<BR>point to the sysfs directory for the given device.&nbsp; /sys/dev provides a<BR>quick way to lookup the sysfs interface for a device from the result of<BR>a stat(2) operation.
