System peripherals (I/O) generally conform to different access rules to Normal memory. Examples of I/O accesses are:<BR>&#8226; FIFOs where consecutive accesses<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; add queued values on write accesses<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; remove queued values on read accesses.<BR>&#8226; interrupt controller registers where an access can be used as an interrupt acknowledge, changing the state of the controller itself<BR>&#8226; memory controller configuration registers that are used to set up the timing and correctness of areas of Normal memory<BR>&#8226; memory-mapped peripherals, where accessing a memory location can cause side effects in the system.
