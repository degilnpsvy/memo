&#8226; After any number of write operations to an operand, the value of the operand is the value written by one of the write operations. It is impossible for part of the value of the operand to come from one write operation and another part of the value to come from a different write operation.<BR>&#8226; When a read operation and a write operation are made to the same operand, the value obtained by the read operation is one of:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; the value of the operand before the write operation<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; the value of the operand after the write operation.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is never the case that the value of the read operation is partly the value of the operand before the write operation and partly the value of the operand after the write operation.
