In ARMv7, regions of the memory map for these accesses are defined as Device or Strongly-ordered memory. To ensure system correctness, access rules for Device and Strongly-ordered memory are more restrictive than those for Normal memory:<BR>&#8226; both read and write accesses can have side effects<BR>&#8226; accesses must not be repeated, for example, on return from an exception<BR>&#8226; the number, order and sizes of the accesses must be maintained.<BR>In addition, for Strongly-ordered memory, all memory accesses are strictly ordered to correspond to the program order of the memory access instructions.
