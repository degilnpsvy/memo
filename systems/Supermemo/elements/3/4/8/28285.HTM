&#8226; Shareable Device memory<BR>&#8226; Non-shareable Device memory.<BR>Non-shareable Device memory is defined as only accessible by a single processor. An example of a system supporting Shareable and Non-shareable Device memory is an implementation that supports both:<BR>&#8226; a local bus for its private peripherals<BR>&#8226; system peripherals implemented on the main shared system bus.<BR>Such a system might have more predictable access times for local peripherals such as watchdog timers or interrupt controllers. In particular, a specific address in a Non-shareable Device memory region might access a different physical peripheral for each processor.
