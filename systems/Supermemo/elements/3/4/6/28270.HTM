A region of Normal memory with the Sharable attribute is one for which the effect of interposing a cache, or caches, on the memory system is entirely transparent to data accesses in the same shareability domain. Explicit software management is needed to ensure the coherency of instruction caches.

<P>Implementations can use a variety of mechanisms to support this management requirement, from simply not caching accesses in Shareable regions to more complex hardware schemes for cache coherency for those regions.
