LDM, LDC, LDC2, LDRD, STM, STC, STC2, STRD, PUSH, POP, VLDR, VSTR, VLDM, VSTM, VPUSH, and VPOP instructions are executed as a sequence of word-aligned word accesses. Each 32-bit word access is guaranteed to be single-copy atomic. A subsequence of two or more word accesses from the sequence might <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR>If an instruction is executed as a sequence of accesses according to these rules, some exceptions can be taken in the sequence and cause execution of the instruction to be abandoned.<BR>On exception return, the instruction that generated the sequence of accesses is re-executed and so any accesses that had already been performed before the exception was taken might be repeated, see Exceptions in Load Multiple and Store Multiple operations on page B1-658.
