GLib provides a standard method of reporting errors from a called function to the calling code. (This is the same problem solved by exceptions in other languages.) It's important to understand that this method is both a data type (the <A title="struct GError" class=link href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Error-Reporting.html#GError"><SPAN class=type>GError</SPAN></A> struct) and a set of rules. If you use <A title="struct GError" class=link href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Error-Reporting.html#GError"><SPAN class=type>GError</SPAN></A> incorrectly, then your code will not properly interoperate with other code that uses <A title="struct GError" class=link href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Error-Reporting.html#GError"><SPAN class=type>GError</SPAN></A>, and users of your API will probably get confused.
