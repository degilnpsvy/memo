<P>From the <A class=ulink href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala" target=_top>Vala homepage</A> itself: <SPAN class=quote>&#8220;<SPAN class=quote>Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C.</SPAN>&#8221;</SPAN> </P>
<P>The syntax of Vala is similar to C#. The available compiler translates Vala into GObject C code. It can also compile non-GObject C, using plain C API.
