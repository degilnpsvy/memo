Note<BR>The Shareable concept enables system designers to specify the locations in Normal memory that must have coherency requirements. However, to facilitate porting of software, software developers must not assume that specifying a memory region as Non-shareable permits software to make assumptions about the incoherency of memory locations between different processors in a shared memory system. Such assumptions are not portable between different multiprocessing implementations that make use of the Shareable concept. Any multiprocessing implementation might implement caches that, inherently, are shared between different processing elements.
