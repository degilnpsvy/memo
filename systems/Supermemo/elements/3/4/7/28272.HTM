Write-through cacheable, Write-back cacheable and Non-cacheable Normal memory 
<P></P>
<P>In addition to being Shareable or Non-shareable, each region of Normal memory can be marked as being one of:<BR><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>The cacheability attributes for a region are independent of the shareability attributes for the region. The cacheability attributes indicate the required handling of the data region if it is used for purposes other than the handling of shared data. This independence means that, for example, a region of memory that is marked as being cacheable and Shareable might not be held in the cache in an implementation where Shareable regions do not cache their data.
