Accesses to Normal memory have a weakly consistent model of memory ordering. See a standard text describing memory ordering issues for a description of weakly consistent memory models, for example chapter 2 of Memory Consistency Models for Shared Memory-Multiprocessors, Kourosh Gharachorloo, Stanford University Technical Report CSL-TR-95-685. <FONT class=extract>In general, for Normal memory, barrier operations are required where the order of memory accesses observed by other observers must be controlled. This requirement applies regardless of the cacheability and shareability attributes of the Normal memory region.</FONT>
