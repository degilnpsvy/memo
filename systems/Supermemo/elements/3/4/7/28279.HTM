Normal memory is idempotent, meaning that it exhibits the following properties:<BR>&#8226; read accesses can be repeated <FONT class=clozed>with no side effects</FONT><BR>&#8226; repeated read accesses return <FONT class=clozed>the last value written to the resource being read</FONT><BR>&#8226; read accesses can prefetch additional memory locations <FONT class=clozed>with no side effects</FONT><BR>&#8226; write accesses can be repeated <FONT class=clozed>with no side effects, provided that the contents of the location are unchanged between the repeated writes</FONT><BR>&#8226; unaligned accesses can <FONT class=clozed>be supported</FONT><BR>&#8226; accesses can be <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
