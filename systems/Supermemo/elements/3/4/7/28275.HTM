Normal memory is idempotent, meaning that it exhibits the following properties:<BR>&#8226; read accesses can be repeated <FONT class=clozed>with no side effects</FONT><BR>&#8226; repeated read accesses return <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR>&#8226; read accesses can prefetch additional memory locations with no side effects<BR>&#8226; write accesses can be repeated with no side effects, provided that the contents of the location are unchanged between the repeated writes<BR>&#8226; unaligned accesses can be supported<BR>&#8226; accesses can be merged before accessing the target memory system.
