Normal memory is idempotent, meaning that it exhibits the following properties:<BR>&#8226; read accesses can be repeated <FONT class=clozed>with no side effects</FONT><BR>&#8226; repeated read accesses return <FONT class=clozed>the last value written to the resource being read</FONT><BR>&#8226; read accesses can prefetch additional memory locations <FONT class=clozed>with no side effects</FONT><BR>&#8226; write accesses can be repeated <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR>&#8226; unaligned accesses can be supported<BR>&#8226; accesses can be merged before accessing the target memory system.
