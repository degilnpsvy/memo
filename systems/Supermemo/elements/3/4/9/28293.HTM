<P>Everything in QOM is a device. The concept of busses are implemented as an interface that a device implements. Devices can have two types of relationships with other devices: device composition or device backlinks. Device composition involves one device directly creating another device. It will own life cycle management for the created device and will generally propagate events to that device (although there are exceptions). </P>
<P>Device backlinks allow one device to refer to another device in a looser fashion. While there can be only one device composition relationship that exists between two specific devices, a device can participate in an arbitrary number of backlinks. </P>
<P>Device composition and backlinks are both strongly typed and can be typed as a specific device type or as an interface. When typed as an interface, any device that implements that interface can be used. </P>
<P>There is no explicit notion of parents in QOM. A typical bus relationship would the bus having a backlink to the child device, and the child device having a backlink to the bus. </P>
<P>Without device backlinks, device composition forms a multi-rooted strict tree. With backlinks, the result are multiple directed graphs.
