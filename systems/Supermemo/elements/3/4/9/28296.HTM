<H3><SPAN id=Properties_in_QDev class=mw-headline>Properties in QDev</SPAN></H3>
<P>Device properties in qdev are bound to classes and map directly to elements of the device structure. They are strongly typed. Each type is parsed directly from a string representation. There is no way to set qdev properties from anything but a string. </P>
<P>Device properties in qdev are only settable during construction. After construction, they are read-only. Devices cannot hook setting or getting of a property.
