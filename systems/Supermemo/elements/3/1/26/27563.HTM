Pseudo-instruction<BR>UAL assembler syntax that assembles to an instruction encoding that is expected to disassemble to a different assembler syntax, and is described in this manual under that other syntax. For example, MOV &lt;Rd&gt;,&lt;Rm&gt;, LSL #&lt;n&gt; is a pseudo-instruction that is expected to disassemble as LSL &lt;Rd&gt;,&lt;Rm&gt;,#&lt;n&gt;
