Blocking<BR><FONT class=clozed>Describes an operation that does not permit following instructions to be executed before the operation is completed.<BR>A non-blocking operation can permit following instructions to be executed before the operation is completed, and in the event of encountering an exception do not signal an exception to the processor. This enables implementations to retire following instructions while the non-blocking operation is executing, without the need to retain precise processor state.</FONT>
