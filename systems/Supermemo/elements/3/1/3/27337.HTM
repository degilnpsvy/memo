ALUWritePC() Write value to PC, with interworking for ARM only from ARMv7 Pseudocode details of ARM core register operations on page A2-46<BR>The LoadWritePC() and ALUWritePC() functions are used for two cases where the behavior was systematically<BR>modified between architecture versions. The functions simplify to aliases of the branch functions in the<BR>M-profile architecture variants:<BR>// LoadWritePC()<BR>// =============<BR>LoadWritePC(bits(32) address)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BXWritePC(address);<BR>// ALUWritePC()<BR>// ============<BR>ALUWritePC(bits(32) address)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BranchWritePC(address);
