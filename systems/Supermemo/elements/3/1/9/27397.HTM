<P>Pseudocode details of operations on exclusive monitors on page B2-698</P>
<P><BR>The IsExclusiveGlobal() function takes as arguments an address, the processor identifier processorid and the size of the transfer. The function returns TRUE if the processor processorid has marked in a global record an address range as exclusive access requested that covers at least the size bytes from the address. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether it returns TRUE or FALSE if a global record has marked a different address as exclusive access requested. If no address is marked in a global record as exclusive access, IsExclusiveGlobal() returns FALSE.
