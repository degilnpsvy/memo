Immediate values<BR>Are values that are encoded directly in the instruction and used as numeric data when the instruction is executed. Many ARM and Thumb instructions permit small numeric values to be encoded as immediate values in the instruction that operates on them. In the ARM architecture, immediate fields are unsigned unless otherwise stated in the instruction description.
