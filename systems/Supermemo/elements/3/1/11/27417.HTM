<P>Pseudocode details of operations on exclusive monitors on page B2-698</P>
<P><BR>The MarkExclusiveLocal() procedure takes as arguments an address, the processor identifier processorid and the size of the transfer. The procedure records in a local record that processor processorid has requested exclusive access to an address covering at least size bytes from the address. The size of the region marked as exclusive is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED, and can at its largest cover the whole of memory, but is no smaller than size, and is aligned in the address space to the size of the region. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this procedure also performs a MarkExclusiveGlobal() using the same parameters.
