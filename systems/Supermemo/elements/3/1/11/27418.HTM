<P><BR>The MarkExclusiveGlobal() procedure takes as arguments an address, the processor identifier processorid and the size of the transfer. The procedure records that processor processorid has requested exclusive access covering at least size bytes from the address. The size of region marked as exclusive is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED, up to a limit of 2KB, and no smaller than size, and aligned in the address space to the size of the region. It is UNPREDICTABLE whether this causes any previous request for exclusive access to any other address by the same processor to be cleared.
