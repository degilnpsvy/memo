<FONT class=clozed>Simple sequential execution</FONT><BR>The behavior of an implementation that fetches, decodes and completely executes each instruction before proceeding to the next instruction. Such an implementation performs no speculative accesses to memory, including to instruction memory. The implementation does not pipeline any phase of execution. In practice, this is the theoretical execution model that the architecture is based on, and ARM does not expect this model to correspond to a realistic implementation of the architecture.
