Should-Be-One-or-Preserved (SBOP)<BR>Must be written as 1, or all 1s for a bit field, by software if the value is being written without having been previously read, or if the register has not been initialized. Where the register was previously read on the same processor since the processor was last reset, the value in the field should be preserved by writing the same value that was previously read.<BR>Hardware must ignore writes to these fields.<BR>If a value is written to the field that is neither 1 (or all 1s for a bit field), nor a value previously read for the same field on the same processor, the result is UNPREDICTABLE.
