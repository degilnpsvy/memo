4.2 Identification
<P></P>
<P>The security extensions will be added as part of the ARMv8-M architecture introduction, as such the changes in the programmers model can be identified by the mechanism used to identify the overall v8M architecture (most likely the "M-profile programmers' model" field within the ID_PRF1 register). No dedicated ID registers for the security extensions are provided.
