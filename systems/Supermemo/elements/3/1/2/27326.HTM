4.4.1 TrustZone Integration 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>In some complex SOC&#8217;s it may be useful to integrate an M-profile processor with an A-profile core (e.g. the M-profile processor could be used for low level power management). In such systems one possible integration strategy would be to connect NS-Attr from the Cortex-M processor to the existing TrustZone NS-Attr, such that instructions executing in the secure state can access secure locations. This approach is also applicable in systems that re-use TrustZone system IP but do not actually contain a processor with the A-profile Security extensions.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Because M-profile processors do not contain an MMU they are not capable of performing any address translation, and are limited a single 4GByte address space. This address space is further restricted by the system memory map as defined in the ARMv7-M specification. In systems where an M-Profile processor coexists with an A-profile processor care must be taken to ensure that the M-profile core can address all memory and peripherals (including both secure and non-secure) that it requires access to. This may require some system level address translation to be performed.</FONT>
