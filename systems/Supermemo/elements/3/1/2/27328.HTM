4.4 Address space protection<BR><FONT class=extract>It is assumed that all memories and other memory mapped peripherals that can be marked as secure are on chip, and therefore encryption is not required in order to protect them.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Any accesses to the address space include a new attribute NS-Attr, which is used to mark transactions as non-secure or secure. The conveyance of NS-Attr is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The security extensions require that:<BR>* Areas of the address space marked as secure must only be accessible by transactions with NS-Attr set to secure. Any accesses to secure addresses with NS-Attr set to non-secure must result in an error being reported to the component that generated the request.<BR>* The processor be able to determine the security status of an address (see Security attribution)</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The security extensions also define a new NS-Req attribute, which defines the security state that the core requests the data transaction be performed in, unless otherwise specified NS-Req is equal to the security state of the core.</FONT>
