HighestSetBit() Position of leftmost 1 in a bitstring Lowest and highest set bits of a bitstring on page AppxF-969<BR>If x is a bitstring, and N = Len(x):<BR>&#8226; LowestSetBit(x) is the minimum bit number of any of its bits that are ones. If all of its bits are zeros,<BR>LowestSetBit(x) = N.<BR>&#8226; HighestSetBit(x) is the maximum bit number of any of its bits that are ones. If all of its bits are zeros,<BR>HighestSetBit(x) = -1.<BR>&#8226; CountLeadingZeroBits(x) = N - 1 - HighestSetBit(x) is the number of zero bits at the left end of x, in the range 0 to N.<BR>&#8226; CountLeadingSignBits(x) = CountLeadingZeroBits(x&lt;N-1:1&gt; EOR x&lt;N-2:0&gt;) is the number of copies of the sign bit of x at the left end of x, excluding the sign bit itself, and is in the range 0 to N-1.
