B4.3 Registers 
<P></P>
<P>RKGST There are the following registers in the base register set:</P>
<P>General-purpose registers, all 32-bit:<BR>&#8226; R0-R12<BR>&#8226; R13. This is the Stack Pointer (SP).<BR>&#8226; R14. This is the Link Register (LR).</P>
<P>Program Counter, 32-bit:<BR>&#8226; R15 is the Program Counter (PC).</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Special-purpose registers<BR>&#8226; Mask Registers:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; 1-bit exception mask register, PRIMASK.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; 8-bit base priority mask register, BASEPRI.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; 1-bit fault mask register, FAULTMASK.<BR>&#8226; A 2-bit, 3-bit, or 4-bit CONTROL register.<BR>&#8226; Two 32-bit Stack Pointer Limit registers, MSPLIM and PSPLIM.<BR>&#8226; A combined 32-bit Program Status Register (XPSR), comprising:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Application Program Status Register (APSR).<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Interrupt Program Status Register (IPSR).<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Execution Program Status Register (EPSR).<BR>&#8226; A 32-bit Combined Exception Return Program Status Register, RETPSR.</FONT></P>
<P>Memory-mapped registers<BR>All other registers.</P>
<P>IDHVL Extensions might add additional registers to the base register set.</P>
<P>RPLRT <FONT class=extract>In a PE with the Main Extension, the LR is set to 0xFFFFFFFF on both of the ARMv8-M resets, Cold reset and Warm reset. Otherwise, it becomes UNKNOWN on both of the ARMv8-M resets.</FONT></P>
<P>RTBGP <FONT class=extract>The LR is updated automatically on exception entry.</FONT></P>
<P>RPLNS <FONT class=extract>The PC is loaded with the reset handler start address on both of the ARMv8-M resets, Cold reset and Warm reset.</FONT></P>
