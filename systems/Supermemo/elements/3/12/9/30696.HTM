D2.2.13 CONTROL, Control Register 
<P></P>
<P>The CONTROL characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides access to the PE control fields.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access only. Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is banked between Security states on a bit by bit basis.</P>
<P>Bits [31:4] Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SFPA, bit [3]<BR>Secure floating-point active. Indicates that the floating-point registers contain active state that belongs to the Secure state.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The floating-point registers do not contain state that belongs to the Secure state.<BR>1 The floating-point registers contain state that belongs to the Secure state.<BR>This bit is accessible from both privileged and unprivileged modes, but unprivileged writes are ignored.<BR>This bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure.<BR>If the Security Extension is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>If the Floating-point Extension is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>FPCA, bit [2]<BR>Floating-point context active. Defines whether the FP Extension is active in the current context.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 FP Extension is not active.<BR>1 FP Extension is active.<BR>When NSACR.CP10 is set to zero, the Non-secure view of this bit is read-only. If FPCCR.ASPEN is set to 1, enabling automatic Floating-point state preservation, then the PE sets this bit to 1 on successful completion of any Floating-point instruction.<BR>If the Floating-point Extension is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SPSEL, bit [1]<BR>Stack-pointer select. Defines the stack pointer to be used.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Use SP_main as the current stack.<BR>1 In Thread mode use SP_process as the current stack.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>nPRIV, bit [0]<BR>Not privileged. Defines the execution privilege in Thread mode.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Thread mode has privileged access.<BR>1 Thread mode has unprivileged access only.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this field is RW or RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT>
