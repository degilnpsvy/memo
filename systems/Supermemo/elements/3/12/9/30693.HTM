D2.2.78 FAULTMASK, Fault Mask Register
<P></P>
<P>The FAULTMASK characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides access to the PE FAULTMASK register.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access only. Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented. This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is banked between Security states.</P>
<P>Bits [31:1] Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>FM, bit [0]<BR>Fault mask enable. The Secure and Non-secure FAULTMASK registers individually boost the current execution priority based on the settings of AIRCR.PRIS and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS. If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero, AIRCR.PRIS is zero, and FAULTMASK_NS.FM is one, the execution priority is boosted to 0. If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero, AIRCR.PRIS is one, and FAULTMASK_NS.FM is one, the execution priority is boosted to 0x80. If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero and FAULTMASK_S is one, the execution priority is boosted to -1. If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is one and FAULTMASK_NS is one, the execution priority is boosted to -1. If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is one and FAULTMASK_S is one, the execution priority is boosted to -3.</P>
<P>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No effect.<BR>1 Boost priority.</P>
<P>On an exception return from a raw execution priority greater or equal to zero, the FM bit corresponding to EXC_RETURN.ES is cleared.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
