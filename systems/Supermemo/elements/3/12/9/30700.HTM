D2.2.76 EPSR, Execution Program Status Register</P>
<P><BR>The EPSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds Execution state bits.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access only. Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P><BR>Bits [31:27] Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><BR>T, bit [24]<BR>T32 state bit. Determines the current instruction set state.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 All instructions generate an INVSTATE UsageFault.<BR>1 Instructions decoded as T32 instructions.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P><BR>Bits [23:16] Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><BR>IT/ICI, bits [15:10, 26:25]<BR>If-then and interrupt continuation. Depending on value, this field encodes either the current condition and position in an IT block sequence, or information on the outstanding register list for an interrupted exception-continuable multi-cycle load or store instruction.<BR>The field IT[7:0] is equivalent to EPSR[15:10,26:25]. The field ICI[7:0] is equivalent to EPSR[26:25,15:10].<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.<BR></P>
<P>Bits [9:0] Reserved, RES0.
