Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>LIMIT, bits [31:3]<BR>Stack limit. Bits [31:3] of the Process stack limit address for the selected Security state.<BR>Many instructions and exception entry will generate an exception if the appropriate stack pointer would be updated to a value lower than this limit. If the Main Extension is not implemented, the Non-secure PSPLIM is RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
