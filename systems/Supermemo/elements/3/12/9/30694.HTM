D2.2.5 <FONT class=extract>BASEPRI, Base Priority Mask Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The BASEPRI characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Changes the priority level required for exception preemption.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access only. Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented. This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P>Bits [31:8] Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>BASEPRI, bits [7:0]<BR>Base priority mask. BASEPRI changes the priority level required for exception preemption. It has an effect only when BASEPRI has a lower value than the unmasked priority level of the currently executing software.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0 Disables masking by BASEPRI.<BR>1-255 Priority value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The number of implemented bits in BASEPRI is the same as the number of implemented bits in each field of the priority registers, and BASEPRI has the same format as those fields.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT>
