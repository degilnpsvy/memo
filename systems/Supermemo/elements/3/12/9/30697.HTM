D2.2.156 MSPLIM, Main Stack Pointer Limit Register</P>
<P>The MSPLIM characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Holds the lower limit of the Main stack pointer.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access only. Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is banked between Security states.</P>
<P>LIMIT, bits [31:3]<BR>Stack limit. Bits [31:3] of the Main stack pointer limit address 'FTSSS.<BR>Many instructions and exception entry will generate an exception if the appropriate stack pointer would be updated to a value lower than this limit. If the Main Extension is not implemented, the Non-secure MSPLIM is RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [2:0] Reserved, RES0.
