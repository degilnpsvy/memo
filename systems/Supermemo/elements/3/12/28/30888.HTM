D2.2.184 SHPR3, System Handler Priority Register 3 
<P></P>
<P>The SHPR3 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Sets or returns priority for system handlers 12 - 15.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED20.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SHPR3_NS located at 0xE002ED20. The location 0xE002ED20 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states on a bit by bit basis.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>PRI_15, bits [31:24]<BR>Priority 15. Priority of system handler 15, SysTick.<BR>If two SysTick timers are implemented this field is banked between Security states.<BR>If less than two SysTick timers are implemented this field is not banked between Security states, and is RAZ/WI if AIRCR.STTNS is zero.<BR>If the PE implements less than 8 bits of priority, then the least significant bits of this field are RES0.<BR>If one timer is implemented this field corresponds to the Secure state if AIRCR.STTNS is zero, or the Non-secure state if AIRCR.STTNS is one.<BR>If only one SysTick timer is implemented and ICSR.STTNS is clear, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>If no SysTick timer is implemented this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>PRI_14, bits [23:16]<BR>Priority 14. Priority of system handler 14, PendSV.<BR>This field is banked between Security states.<BR>If the PE implements less than 8 bits of priority, then the least significant bits of this field are RES0.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT class=extract>PRI_12, bits [7:0]<BR>Priority 12. Priority of system handler 12, DebugMonitor.<BR>This field is not banked between Security states.<BR>If DEMCR.SDME is 1, this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state. If the PE implements less than 8 bits of priority, then the least significant bits of this field are RES0.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT>
