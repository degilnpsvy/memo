B4.7 Security states, register banking between them 
<P></P>
<P>IMGRQ In a PE with the Security Extension, some registers are banked between the Security states. When a register is banked in this way, there is a physical instance of the register in Secure state and another physical instance of the register in Non-secure state.<BR>RBHDK In a PE with the Security Extension:<BR>&#8226; The general-purpose registers that are banked are:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; R13. This is the Stack Pointer (SP).<BR>&#8226; The special-purpose registers that are banked are:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The Mask registers, PRIMASK, BASEPRI, and FAULTMASK.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The CONTROL register.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The main and process Stack Pointer Limit registers, MSPLIM and PSPLIM.<BR>&#8226; The System Control Space (SCS) is banked.<BR>IGBWT <FONT class=extract>For MRS and MSR instructions, SYSm[7] in the instruction encoding specifies whether the Secure or the Non-secure instance of a banked register is accessed</FONT>:<BR>IMKKR This specification uses the following naming convention to identify banked registers:<BR>&lt;register name&gt;_S The Secure instance of the register.<BR>&lt;register name&gt;_NS The Non-secure instance of the register.<BR>&lt;register name&gt; The instance associated with the current Security state.</P>
