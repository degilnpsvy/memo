ARM defines three architecture profiles:<BR>A Application profile:<BR>&#8226; Supports a Virtual Memory System Architecture (VMSA) based on a Memory Management Unit (MMU).<BR>&nbsp; Note<BR>&nbsp; An ARMv8-A implementation can be called an AArchv8-A implementation.<BR>&#8226; Supports the A64, A32, and T32 instruction sets.<BR>R Real-time profile:<BR>&#8226; Supports a Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA) based on a Memory Protection Unit (MPU).<BR>&#8226; Supports the A32 and T32 instruction sets.<BR>M Microcontroller profile, described in this manual:<BR>&#8226; Implements a programmers' model designed for low-latency interrupt processing, with hardware stacking of registers and support for writing interrupt handlers in high-level languages.<BR>&#8226; Optionally implements a variant of the R-profile PMSA.<BR>&#8226; Supports a variant of the T32 instruction set.
