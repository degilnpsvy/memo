A1.2 The ARMv8-M architecture profile 
<P></P>
<P>The ARM architecture has evolved through several major versions to a point where it supports implementations across a wide spectrum of performance points, with over a billion parts per annum being produced. The latest versions, ARMv7 and ARMv8, formally recognize this diversity by defining a set of architecture profiles that tailor the architecture to different market requirements. A key factor is that the application level is consistent across all profiles, and the bulk of the variation is at the system level.</P>
<P>The introduction of Thumb&#174;-2 technology in ARMv6T2 provided a balance to the A32 and T32 instruction sets, and the opportunity for the ARM architecture to be extended into new markets, in particular the microcontroller marketplace. To take maximum advantage of this opportunity, ARM introduced the M architecture profile for microcontroller implementations, complementing its strengths in the high-performance and real-time embedded markets. ARMv8-M is a T32-only profile with a different system level programmers&#8217; model from the A and R architecture profiles.</P>
<P>ARMv8-M satisfies the following key implementation criteria:<BR>&#8226; Enables implementations with industry leading power, performance, and area constraints:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Provides opportunities for simple pipeline designs offering leading edge system performance levels in a broad range of markets and applications.<BR>&#8226; Highly deterministic operation:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Single or low cycle count execution.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Minimal interrupt latency, with short pipelines.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Capable of cacheless operation.<BR>&#8226; Excellent C/C++ target. This aligns with the ARM programming standards in this area:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Exception handlers are standard C/C++ functions, entered using standard calling conventions.<BR>&#8226; Designed for deeply embedded systems:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Low pincount devices.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; Enables new entry level opportunities for the ARM architecture.<BR>&#8226; Provides debug and software profiling support for event-driven systems.<BR>ARMv8-M offers key improvements in a number of areas, including:<BR>&#8226; The Security Extension.<BR>&#8226; An improved Memory Protection Unit (MPU) model.<BR>&#8226; Alignment with ARMv8-A and ARMv8-R memory types.<BR>&#8226; Stack pointer limit checking.<BR>&#8226; A refined debug system.<BR>&#8226; Improved support for multi-processing.<BR>&#8226; Better alignment with C11 and C11++ standards.
