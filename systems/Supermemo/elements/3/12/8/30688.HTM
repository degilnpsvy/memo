BFHFNMINS, bit [13]<BR><FONT class=clozed>BusFault, HardFault, and NMI Non-secure enable. The value of this bit defines whether BusFault and NMI exceptions are Non-secure, and whether exceptions target the Non-secure HardFault exception.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 BusFault, HardFault, and NMI are Secure.<BR>1 BusFault and NMI are Non-secure and exceptions can target Non-secure HardFault.<BR>If an implementation resets into Secure state, this bit resets to zero. If an implementation does not support Secure state, this bit is RAO/WI. To allow lock down of this filed it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this bit is writable. The effect of setting both BFHFNMINS and PRIS to 1 is UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>This bit is read-only from Non-secure.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT>
