A1.3 ARMv8-M variants 
<P></P>
<P>RFHPH <FONT class=extract>The ARMv8-M architecture has the following optional extensions:<BR>&#8226; The Main Extension.<BR>&#8226; The Security Extension.<BR>&#8226; The Floating-point Extension.<BR>&#8226; The Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Extension.<BR>&#8226; The Debug Extension.</FONT></P>
<P>RFXRP <FONT class=extract>A PE can only implement the Floating-point Extension if it also implements the Main Extension.</FONT><BR>RMGVL <FONT class=extract>A PE can only implement the DSP Extension if it also implements the Main Extension.</FONT><BR>IWCCN <FONT class=extract>The ARMv8-M Security Extension can also be referred to as ARM&#174; TrustZone&#174; for ARMv8-M.</FONT><BR>ITLHM <FONT class=extract>A PE with the Main Extension is also referred to as a Mainline implementation.</FONT><BR>IGFDP <FONT class=extract>A PE without the Main Extension is also referred to as a Baseline implementation. A Baseline implementation has a subset of the instructions, registers, and features, of a Mainline implementation.</FONT><BR>ILCJN <FONT class=extract>ARMv6-M compatibility is provided by all ARMv8-M implementations.</FONT><BR>ISQKT <FONT class=extract>ARMv7-M compatibility requires the Main Extension.</FONT>
