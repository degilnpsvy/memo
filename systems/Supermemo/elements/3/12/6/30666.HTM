<P>RCTPC <FONT class=extract>It is not possible to have a Cold reset without also having a Warm reset.</FONT><BR>RFNNX <FONT class=extract>On a Cold reset, registers that have a defined reset value contain that value.</FONT><BR>RGTXW <FONT class=extract>On a Warm reset, some debug register control fields that have a defined reset value remain unchanged, but otherwise all registers that have a defined reset value contain that value.</FONT><BR>RYMHN <FONT class=extract>On a Warm reset, the PE performs the actions that are&nbsp;described by the TakeReset() pseudocode.</FONT><BR>RWSZN <FONT class=extract>AIRCR.SYSRESETREQ is required to cause a Warm reset.</FONT><BR>RHFRS <FONT class=extract>For AIRCR.SYSRESETREQ, the architecture does not guarantee that the reset takes place immediately.</FONT><BR>RDJPD <FONT class=extract>A Warm reset takes the PE out of Debug state.</FONT>
