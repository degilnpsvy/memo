D2.2.165 NVIC_ISER&lt;n&gt;, Interrupt Set Enable Register, n = 0 - 15</P>
<P>The NVIC_ISER&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Enables or reads the enabled state of each group of 32 interrupts.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write-one-to-set register located at 0xE000E100 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via NVIC_ISER&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002E100 + 4n. The location 0xE002E100 + 4n is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>SETENA, bits [31:0], on a write<BR>Set enable. For SETENA[m] in NVIC_ISERn, allows interrupt 32n + m to be set enabled.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 No effect.<BR>1 Enable interrupt 32n + m.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>SETENA, bits [31:0], on a read<BR>Set enable. For SETENA[m] in NVIC_ISERn, indicates whether interrupt 32n + m is enabled.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt 32n + m disabled.<BR>1 Interrupt 32n + m enabled.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
