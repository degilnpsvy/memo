D2.2.161 <FONT class=extract>NVIC_IABR&lt;n&gt;, Interrupt Active Bit Register, n = 0 - 15</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The NVIC_IABR&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: For each group of 32 interrupts, shows the active state of each interrupt.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000E300 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via NVIC_IABR&lt;n&gt;_NS located at 0xE002E300 + 4n. The location 0xE002E300 + 4n is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>ACTIVE, bits [31:0]<BR>Active state. For ACTIVE[m] in NVIC_IABRn, indicates the active state for interrupt 32n+m.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt not active.<BR>1 Interrupt is active.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT>
