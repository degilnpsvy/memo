<H1 class=title>Exercise 15: Reading Files</H1>
<P id=p1>You know how to get input from a user with <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT> or <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT>. Now you will learn about reading from a file. You may have to play with this exercise the most to understand what's going on, so do the exercise carefully and remember your checks. Working with files is an easy way to <EM>erase your work</EM> if you are not careful.</P>
<P id=p2>This exercise involves writing two files. One is the usual <TT class="docutils literal">ex15.py</TT> file that you will run, but the <EM>other</EM> is named <TT class="docutils literal">ex15_sample.txt</TT>. This second file isn't a script but a plain text file we'll be reading in our script. Here are the contents of that file:</P><PRE class=literal-block>This is stuff I typed into a file.
It is really cool stuff.
Lots and lots of fun to have in here.
</PRE>
<P id=p3>What we want to do is "open" that file in our script and print it out. However, we do not want to just "hard code" the name <TT class="docutils literal">ex15_sample.txt</TT> into our script. "Hard coding" means putting some bit of information that should come from the user as a string directly in our source code. That's bad because we want it to load other files later. The solution is to use <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> or <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT> to ask the user what file to open instead of "hard coding" the file's name.</P>

<P id=p4>A few fancy things are going on in this file, so let's break it down real quick:</P>
<P id=p5>Lines 1-3 uses <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> to get a filename. Next we have line 5 where we use a new command <TT class="docutils literal">open</TT>. Right now, run <TT class="docutils literal">pydoc open</TT> and read the instructions. Notice how like your own scripts and <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT>, it takes a parameter and returns a value you can set to your own variable. You just opened a file.</P>
<P id=p6>Line 7 prints a little message, but on line 8 we have something very new and exciting. We call a function on <TT class="docutils literal">txt</TT> named <TT class="docutils literal">read</TT>. What you get back from <TT class="docutils literal">open</TT> is a <TT class="docutils literal">file</TT>, and it also has commands you can give it. You give a file a command by using the <TT class="docutils literal">.</TT> (dot or period), the name of the command, and parameters. Just like with <TT class="docutils literal">open</TT> and <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT>. The difference is that <TT class="docutils literal">txt.read()</TT> says, "Hey <TT class="docutils literal">txt</TT>! Do your read command with no parameters!"</P>
<P id=p7>The remainder of the file is more of the same, but we'll leave the analysis to you in the Study Drills.</P>

<P id=p8 class="first admonition-title">Warning</P>
<P id=p9 class=last>Pay attention! I said <EM>pay attention</EM>! You have been running scripts with just the name of the script, but now that you are using <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> you have to add arguments. Look at the very first line of the example below and you will see I do <TT class="docutils literal">python ex15.py ex15_sample.txt</TT> to run it. See the extra argument <TT class="docutils literal">ex15_sample.txt</TT> after the <TT class="docutils literal">ex15.py</TT> script name. If you do not type that you will get an error so <EM>pay attention!</EM></P></DIV>

<P id=p11>This is a big jump so be sure you do this Study Drill as best you can before moving on.</P>
<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>Above each line, write out in English what that line does. 
<LI>If you are not sure ask someone for help or search online. Many times searching for "python THING" will find answers to what that THING does in Python. Try searching for "python open." 
<LI>I used the word "commands" here, but commands are also called "functions" and "methods." You will learn about functions and methods later in the book. 
<LI>Get rid of the lines 10-15 where you use <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT> and run the script again. 
<LI>Use only <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT> and try the script that way. Why is one way of getting the filename better than another? 
<LI>Start <TT class="docutils literal">python</TT> to start the <TT class="docutils literal">python</TT> shell, and use <TT class="docutils literal">open</TT> from the prompt just like in this program. Notice how you can open files and run <TT class="docutils literal">read</TT> on them from within <TT class="docutils literal">python</TT>? 
<LI>Have your script also call <TT class="docutils literal">close()</TT> on the <TT class="docutils literal">txt</TT> and <TT class="docutils literal">txt_again</TT> variables. It's important to close files when you are done with them.</LI></OL></DIV>

<H1>Common Student Questions</H1>
<DL class=docutils>
<DT>Does <TT class="docutils literal">txt = open(filename)</TT> return the contents of the file? 
<DD>No, it doesn't. It actually makes something called a "file object." You can think of a file like an old tape drive that you saw on mainframe computers in the 1950s, or even like a DVD player from today. You can move around inside them, and then "read" them, but the DVD player is not the DVD the same way the file object is not the file's contents. 
<DT>I can't type code into my Terminal/PowerShell like you say in Study Drill 7. 
<DD>First thing, from the command line just type <TT class="docutils literal">python</TT> and press Enter. Now you are in <TT class="docutils literal">python</TT> as we've done a few other times. Then you can type in code and Python will run it in little pieces. Play with that. To get out of it type <TT class="docutils literal">quit()</TT> and hit Enter. 
<DT>Why is there no error when we open the file twice? 
<DD>Python will not restrict you from opening a file more than once and sometimes this is necessary. 
<DT>What does <TT class="docutils literal">from sys import argv</TT> mean? 
<DD>For now just understand that <TT class="docutils literal">sys</TT> is a package, and this phrase just says to get the <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> feature from that package. You'll learn more about these later. 
<DT>I put the name of the file in as <TT class="docutils literal">script, ex15_sample.txt = argv</TT> but it doesn't work. 
<DD>No, that's not how you do it. Make the code exactly like mine, then run it from the command line the exact same way I do. You don't put the names of files in, you let Python put the name in.</DD></DL></DIV>
