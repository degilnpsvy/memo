<H1 class=title>Exercise 13: Parameters, Unpacking, Variables</H1>
<P id=p1>In this exercise we will cover one more input method you can use to pass variables to a script (script being another name for your <TT class="docutils literal">.py</TT> files). You know how you type <TT class="docutils literal">python ex13.py</TT> to run the <TT class="docutils literal">ex13.py</TT> file? Well the <TT class="docutils literal">ex13.py</TT> part of the command is called an "argument." What we'll do now is write a script that also accepts arguments.</P>
<P id=p2>Type this program and I'll explain it in detail:</P>

<P id=p3>On line <TT class="docutils literal">1</TT> we have what's called an "import." This is how you add features to your script from the Python feature set. Rather than give you all the features at once, Python asks you to say what you plan to use. This keeps your programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other programmers who read your code later.</P>
<P id=p4>The <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> is the "argument variable," a very standard name in programming, that you will find used in many other languages. This variable <EM>holds</EM> the arguments you pass to your Python script when you run it. In the exercises you will get to play with this more and see what happens.</P>
<P id=p5>Line 3 "unpacks" <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variables you can work with: <TT class="docutils literal">script</TT>, <TT class="docutils literal">first</TT>, <TT class="docutils literal">second</TT>, and <TT class="docutils literal">third</TT>. This may look strange, but "unpack" is probably the best word to describe what it does. It just says, "Take whatever is in argv, unpack it, and assign it to all of these variables on the left in order."</P>
<P id=p6>After that we just print them out like normal.</P>
<DIV id=hold-up-features-have-another-name class=section>
<H1>Hold Up! Features Have Another Name</H1>
<P id=p7>I call them "features" here (these little things you <TT class="docutils literal">import</TT> to make your Python program do more) but nobody else calls them features. I just used that name because I needed to trick you into learning what they are without jargon. Before you can continue, you need to learn their real name: <TT class="docutils literal">modules</TT>.</P>
<P id=p8>From now on we will be calling these "features" that we <TT class="docutils literal">import</TT> <EM>modules</EM>. I'll say things like, "You want to import the <TT class="docutils literal">sys</TT> module." They are also called "libraries" by other programmers, but let's just stick with modules.</P></DIV>

<DIV class=warning>
<P id=p9 class="first admonition-title">Warning</P>
<P id=p10 class=last>Pay attention! You have been running python scripts without command line arguments. If you type only <TT class="docutils literal">python ex13.py</TT> you are <EM>doing it wrong!</EM> Pay close attention to how I run it. This applies any time you see <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> being used.</P></DIV>
<P id=p11>Run the program like this (and you <EM>must</EM> pass <EM>three</EM> command line arguments):</P>

<P id=p12>This is what you should see when you do a few different runs with different arguments:</P>

<P id=p13>You can actually replace <TT class="docutils literal">first</TT>, <TT class="docutils literal">2nd</TT>, and <TT class="docutils literal">3rd</TT> with any three things you want.</P>
<P id=p14>If you do not run it correctly, then you will get an error like this:</P>
<DIV class=highlight><PRE><SPAN></SPAN><A name=python--ex13.sh-idio-shint-pyg.html-1></A><SPAN class=gp>$</SPAN> python ex13.py first 2nd

<A name=python--ex13.sh-idio-shint-pyg.html-5></A><SPAN class=go>ValueError: need more than 3 values to unpack</SPAN>
</PRE></DIV>
<P id=p15>This happens when you do not put enough arguments on the command when you run it (in this case just <TT class="docutils literal">first 2nd</TT>). Notice when I run it I give it <TT class="docutils literal">first 2nd</TT>, which caused it to give an error about "need more than 3 values to unpack" telling you that you didn't give it enough parameters.</P></DIV>

<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>Try giving fewer than three arguments to your script. See that error you get? See if you can explain it. 
<LI>Write a script that has fewer arguments and one that has more. Make sure you give the unpacked variables good names. 
<LI>Combine <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT> with <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> to make a script that gets more input from a user. Don't over think it. Just use <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> to get something, and <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input</TT> to get something else from the user.

<DL class=docutils>
<DT>When I run it I get <TT class="docutils literal">ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack</TT>. 
<DD>Remember that an important skill is paying attention to details. If you look at the <EM>What You Should See</EM> section you see that I run the script with parameters on the command line. You should replicate how I ran it exactly. 
<DT>What's the difference between <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> and <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input()</TT>? 
<DD>The difference has to do with where the user is required to give input. If they give your script inputs on the command line, then you use <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT>. If you want them to input using the keyboard while the script is running, then use <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input()</TT>. 
<DT>Are the command line arguments strings? 
<DD>Yes, they come in as strings, even if you typed numbers on the command line. Use <TT class="docutils literal">int()</TT> to convert them just like with <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>int(raw_input())</SPAN></TT>. 
<DT>How do you use the command line? 
<DD>You should have learned to use it real quick by now, but if you need to learn it at this stage, then read the Command Line Crash Course I wrote for this book in Appendix A. 
<DT>I can't combine <TT class="docutils literal">argv</TT> with <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input()</TT>. 
<DD>Don't overthink it. Just slap two lines at the end of this script that uses <TT class="docutils literal">raw_input()</TT> to get something and then print it. From that start playing with more ways to use both in the same script. 
<DT>Why can't I do this <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>raw_input('?</SPAN> ') = x</TT>? 
<DD>Because that's backward to how it should work. Do it the way I do it and it'll work.</DD></DL></DIV>
