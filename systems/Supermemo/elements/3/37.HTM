There are <SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> two basic methods of building the knowledge tree</SPAN></FONT>: 
<P></P>
<P>1,Using the contents window. You can use operations such as Add, Insert or Delete to build the tree directly in the Contents window </P>
<P>2,Using categories. If you want to add a large number of similarly looking items to a single branch, you will rather want to use Categories. Categories automatically use templates to make sure that your elements are filled out with components of a desired look, number, size, etc. ~</P>
<P>When you choose Add new, new items are added to a single location determined by the current category (i.e. not by the current selection in the contents window). Advanced users will always prefer using categories to save learning time. <FONT class=extract>Usually you add all your material to a To Do branch. Then you move only the most important portions of knowledge to separate categories.</FONT>
