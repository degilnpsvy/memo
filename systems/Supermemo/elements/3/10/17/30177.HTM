/* Define a type and accessor macros for variables.&nbsp; Using pointer types<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; is nice because <FONT class=clozed>it gives some level of type safely</FONT>.&nbsp; Converting to and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; from intptr_t rather than int <FONT class=clozed>reduces the number of sign-extension<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; instructions that get implied on 64-bit hosts</FONT>.&nbsp; Users of tcg_gen_* don't<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; need to know about any of this, and should treat TCGv as <FONT class=clozed>an opaque type</FONT>.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition we do typechecking for different types of variables.&nbsp; TCGv_i32<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; and TCGv_i64 are 32/64-bit variables respectively.&nbsp; TCGv and TCGv_ptr<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; are aliases for <FONT class=clozed>target_ulong and host pointer sized values </FONT>respectively.&nbsp; */
