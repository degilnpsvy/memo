* Helpers: 
<P></P>
<P>Using the tcg_gen_helper_x_y it is possible to call any function taking i32, i64 or pointer types. By default, before calling a helper, all globals are stored at their canonical location and it is assumed that the function can modify them. By default, the helper is allowed to modify the CPU state or raise an exception. </P>
<P>This can be overridden using the following function modifiers: </P>
<P>- TCG_CALL_NO_READ_GLOBALS means that the helper does not read globals, either directly or via an exception. They will not be saved to their canonical locations before calling the helper. </P>
<P>- TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS means that the helper does not modify any globals. They will only be saved to their canonical location before calling helpers, but they won't be reloaded afterwise. </P>
<P>- TCG_CALL_NO_SIDE_EFFECTS means that the call to the function is removed if the return value is not used. Note that TCG_CALL_NO_READ_GLOBALS implies TCG_CALL_NO_WRITE_GLOBALS. On some TCG targets (e.g. x86), several calling conventions are supported.
