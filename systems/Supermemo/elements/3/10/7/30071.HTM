<P>When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints, it needs to know which operands are read by the instruction and which are written by it. &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; identifies an operand which is only written; &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; identifies an operand that is both read and written; all other operands are assumed to only be read. </P>
<P>If you specify &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in a constraint, you put it in the first character of the constraint string.</P></SPAN></SAMP>
