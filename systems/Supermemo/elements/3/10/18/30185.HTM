The MemU[] function performs a memory access at the current privilege level, and the MemU_unpriv[] function performs an access that is always unprivileged.<BR>In both cases:<BR>&#8226; if the CCR.UNALIGN_TRP bit is 0, unaligned accesses are supported<BR>&#8226; if the CCR.UNALIGN_TRP bit is 1, unaligned accesses produce Alignment faults.
