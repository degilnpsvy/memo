<DD>An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed. Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less than a word wide. Constraints for these operands should use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>n</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; rather than &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>i</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;.&nbsp;
