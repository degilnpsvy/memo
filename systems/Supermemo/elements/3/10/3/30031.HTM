<DD>A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is <DFN>offsettable</DFN>. This means that adding a small integer (actually, the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode) may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory address. 
<P><A name=index-autoincrement_002fdecrement-addressing-3666></A>For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement address is not offsettable. More complicated indirect/indexed addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other addressing modes that the machine supports. </P>
<P>Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another operand, the constraint letter &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is valid only when accompanied by both &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>&lt;</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (if the target machine has predecrement addressing) and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>&gt;</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).&nbsp;</P>
