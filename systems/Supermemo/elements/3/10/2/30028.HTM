The compiler copies the assembler instructions in a basic <CODE>asm</CODE> verbatim to the assembly language output file, without processing dialects or any of the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; operators that are available with extended <CODE>asm</CODE>. This results in minor differences between basic <CODE>asm</CODE> strings and extended <CODE>asm</CODE> templates. For example, to refer to registers you might use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%eax</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in basic <CODE>asm</CODE> and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%%eax</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in extended <CODE>asm</CODE>.
