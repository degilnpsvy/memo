Do not expect a sequence of <CODE>asm</CODE> statements to remain perfectly consecutive after compilation. If certain instructions need to remain consecutive in the output, put them in a single multi-instruction <CODE>asm</CODE> statement. Note that GCC's optimizers can move <CODE>asm</CODE> statements relative to other code, including across jumps.
