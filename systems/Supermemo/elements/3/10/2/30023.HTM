<DT>&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; 
<DD>Declares the instruction to be commutative for this operand and the following operand. This means that the compiler may interchange the two operands if that is the cheapest way to make all operands fit the constraints. &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; applies to all alternatives and must appear as the first character in the constraint. Only read-only operands can use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. 
<P>GCC can only handle one commutative pair in an asm; if you use more, the compiler may fail. Note that you need not use the modifier if the two alternatives are strictly identical; this would only waste time in the reload pass.</P></DD>
