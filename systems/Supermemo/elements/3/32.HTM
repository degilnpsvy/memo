You can easily change the attributes of elements and their components by using menus available with a right click. There are two menus you will need to become familiar with: 
<P></P>
<P>Element menu (Alt+F10) which can be opened by a right click over an empty element area or over the element toolbar. Some exemplary functions of the element menu that help you change the look of the element: </P>
<P>*Color changes the color of the element </P>
<P>*Edit : Title (Alt+T) makes it possible to edit the title of the element or select a text to be used as the title Delete components deletes selected components from an element </P>
<P>*Edit : <FONT class=extract>Duplicate (Alt+D) creates an exact copy of the current element in your collection </FONT></P>
<P>*Edit : Swap Q&amp;A (Shift+Ctrl+S) swaps the question with the answer (e.g. when learning words of a foreign language) </P>
<P>*<FONT class=extract>Template : Apply template (Shift+Ctrl+M) allows you to choose from a list of looks defined earlier and change the style of your element</FONT></P>
<P>Component menu (Alt+F12) which can be opened by a right click over a selected component. Some exemplary functions of the component menu that help you change the look of components (these functions may or may not appear on the menu depending on the context): </P>
<P>*Color changes the color of the component </P>
<P>*Import file makes it possible to show a given file inside the component (e.g. picture, HTML file, etc.) </P>
<P>*Text : Font : Edit font changes the font of the selected text </P>
<P>*Delete component removes the component </P>
<P>*Display at defines when the component should be visible (e.g. at answer time) and when it should be hidden (e.g. at question time). You can use Alt+click over a component to switch it to the editing mode. This will make it possible to resize the component, edit texts, etc. If you Alt+click the component again, it will switch to the dragging mode in which you will also be able to move it to another location in the element area. Press Esc to switch the components back to the presentation mode
