Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) 
<P></P>
<P>The DSB instruction is a special memory barrier, that synchronizes the execution stream with memory accesses. The DSB instruction takes the required shareability domain and required access types as arguments. A DSB behaves as a DMB with the same arguments, and also has the additional properties defined here.</P>
<P>Note</P>
<P>ARMv7-M only supports system-wide barriers with no shareability domain or access type limitations.</P>
<P>A DSB completes when both:<BR><FONT class=clozed>&#8226; all explicit memory accesses that are observed by Pe before the DSB is executed, are of the required access types, and are from observers in the same required shareability domain as Pe, are complete for the set of observers within the required shareability domain<BR>&#8226; all explicit accesses to the system control space (SCS) that result in a context altering operation issued by Pe before the DSB are complete.</FONT></P>
