Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) 
<P></P>
<P>The DSB instruction is a special memory barrier, that synchronizes the execution stream with memory accesses. The DSB instruction takes the required shareability domain and required access types as arguments. A DSB behaves as a DMB with the same arguments, and also has the additional properties defined here.</P>
<P>Note</P>
<P>ARMv7-M only supports system-wide barriers with no shareability domain or access type limitations.</P>
<P>A DSB completes when both:<BR><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze></SPAN>In addition, no instruction that appears in program order after the DSB instruction can execute until the DSB completes.</P>
<P>For details of the DSB instruction see DSB on page A7-269.
