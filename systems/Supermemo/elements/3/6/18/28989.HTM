<FONT class=extract>A SecureFault is generated if a security violation is detected (e.g. an access to secure memory with NS-Req set to non-secure).</FONT> Requests that cause a SecureFault to be generated do not result in a memory access being performed, similarly such accesses do not result in a MemManage fault being generated, regardless of the MPU configuration (NOTE: it is not usually possible for instruction fetches to generate a SecureFault). Syndrome information associated with the SecureFault is reported in SFSR and SFAR. This fault is distinct from the MemManage fault as it indicates an attempt to breach the security of the secure state, and therefore needs to be handled differently, as such the firmware vendors might want to assign different priorities to these two faults. The full process of checking both the security attribution and the MPU is depicted in Figure 2.
