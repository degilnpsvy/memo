By default memory is marked as being secure, unless the address matches a region with SAU_REGIONn.ENABLE set to 1 and SAU_REGIONn.NSC set to 0, in which case the memory is marked as being non-secure. An address is defined as matching a region in the SAU if SAU_REGIONn.BADDR &lt;= Address &lt;= SAU_REGIONn.LADDR. Any address that matches multiple SAU regions is marked as secure, and not non-secure callable (I.E. NSC=0) regardless of the attributes specified by the regions that matched the address.</FONT></SPAN>
