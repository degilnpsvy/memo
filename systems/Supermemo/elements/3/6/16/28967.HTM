In some complex SOC&#8217;s it may be useful to integrate an M-profile processor with an A-profile core (e.g. the M-profile processor could be used for low level power management). In such systems one possible integration strategy would be to connect NS-Attr from the Cortex-M processor to the existing TrustZone NS-Attr, such that instructions executing in the secure state can access secure locations. This approach is also applicable in systems that re-use TrustZone system IP but do not actually contain a processor with the A-profile Security extensions.
