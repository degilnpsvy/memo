<FONT class=extract>The attribution information from the SAU is used unless the IDAU specifies attributes with a higher security, in which case the IDAU attributes override the SAU attributes.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The following address ranges are exempt from memory attribution by both the SAU and IDAU and have fixed behavior:<BR>* 0xF0000000 -&gt; 0xFFFFFFFF: If the processor implements the security extensions this memory range is always marked as secure and not non-secure callable for instruction fetches. If the security extensions are not present this range is marked as non-secure</FONT>.<BR>* The address ranges listed below are marked with the security state indicated by NS-Req (I.E. the current state of the processor for non-debug accesses). This effectively makes them exempt from security violation checking, and sets NS-Attr to NS-Req:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oxE0000000 -&gt; 0xE0002FFF: ITM, DWT, FPB<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xE000E000 -&gt; 0xE000EFFF: SCS range<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xE002E000 -&gt; 0xE002EFFF: SCS NS alias range<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xE0040000 -&gt; 0xE0041FFF: TPIU, ETM<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xE00FF000 -&gt; 0xE00FFFFF: ROM table<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0xE0000000 -&gt; 0xEFFFFFFF: for instruction fetch only<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional address ranges specified by the IDAU
