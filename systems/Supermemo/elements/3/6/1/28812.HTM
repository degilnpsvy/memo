The architecture reserves address space 0xE0000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF for system-level use. ARM reserves the first 1MB of this system address space, <FONT class=clozed>0xE0000000 to 0xE00FFFFF</FONT>, as the Private Peripheral Bus (PPB).The assignment of the rest of the address space, from 0xE0100000, is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, with some memory attribute restrictions. See The system address map on page B3-704 for more information.
