Normal sequential execution of instructions effectively calculates:<BR>(address_of_current_instruction) + (2 or 4) /*16- and 32-bit instr mix*/<BR>after each instruction to determine which instruction to execute next. If this calculation overflows the top of the address space, the result is <FONT class=clozed>UNPREDICTABLE</FONT>. In ARMv7-M this condition cannot occur because <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. See The system address map on page B3-704 for more details. An access violation will be reported if this scenario occurs.
