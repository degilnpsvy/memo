Interrupts are often divided into synchronous and asynchronous interrupts: 
<P></P>
<P>l Synchronous interrupts are produced by the CPU control unit while executing instructions and are called synchronous because <FONT class=clozed>the control unit issues them only after terminating the execution of an instruction</FONT>. </P>
<P>l Asynchronous interrupts are generated by other hardware devices at <FONT class=clozed>arbitrary times with respect to the CPU clock signals</FONT><SPAN lang=EN-US><FONT size=3 face=Calibri>.</FONT></SPAN>
