RCU's fundamental guarantee may be used by splitting updates into <FONT class=clozed><I>removal</I> and <I>reclamatio<FONT class=clozed>n</FONT></I></FONT> phases. The removal phase removes references to data items within a data structure (possibly by replacing them with references to new versions of these data items), and can run concurrently with RCU read-side critical sections. The reason that it is safe to run the removal phase concurrently with RCU readers is the semantics of modern CPUs guarantee that readers will see either the old or the new version of the data structure rather than a partially updated reference. Once a grace period has elapsed, there can no longer be any readers referencing the old version, so it is then safe for the reclamation phase to free (<I>reclaim</I>) the data items that made up that old version.<SUP id=cite_ref-3 class=reference><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-copy-update#cite_note-3">[2]</A></SUP>
