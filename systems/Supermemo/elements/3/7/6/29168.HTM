For example, if you allocate some data and then pass it to another<BR>thread to process: 
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]data_release, more_data_handling, my_data_handler</SPAN></P>
<P>This way, it doesn't matter what order the two threads handle the data, the kref_put() handles knowing when the data is not referenced any more and releasing it.&nbsp; The kref_get() does not require a lock, since <FONT class=clozed>we already have a valid pointer that we own a refcount for</FONT>.&nbsp; The put needs no lock because <FONT class=clozed>nothing tries to get the data without already holding a pointer</FONT>.
