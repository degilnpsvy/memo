A4.4.6 Divide instructions 
<P></P>
<P>In the ARMv7-M profile, the Thumb instruction set includes signed and unsigned integer divide instructions that are implemented in hardware. For details of the instructions see:<BR>&#8226; SDIV on page A7-423<BR>&#8226; UDIV on page A7-529.<BR>In the ARMv7-M profile, the CCR.DIV_0_TRP bit enables divide by zero fault detection:<BR>DZ == 0 <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.<BR>DZ == 1 <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>.<BR>A reset clears the CCR.DIV_0_TRP bit to zero.
