&lt;q&gt; Specifies optional assembler qualifiers on the instruction. The following qualifiers are defined:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .N Meaning narrow, specifies that the assembler must select a 16-bit encoding for the instruction. If this is not possible, an assembler error is produced.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .W Meaning wide, specifies that the assembler must select a 32-bit encoding for the instruction. If this is not possible, an assembler error is produced.</P>
<P>If neither .W nor .N is specified, the assembler can select either 16-bit or 32-bit encodings. If both are available, it must select a 16-bit encoding. In a few cases, more than one encoding of the same length can be available for an instruction. The rules for selecting between such encodings are instruction-specific and are part of the instruction description.
