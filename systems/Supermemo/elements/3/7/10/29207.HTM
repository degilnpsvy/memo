<P>The Exceptions subsection contains a list of the exceptional conditions that can be caused by execution of the instruction.<BR>Processor exceptions are listed as follows:<BR><FONT class=extract>&#8226; Resets and interrupts, including NMI, PendSV and SysTick, are not listed. They can occur before or after the execution of any instruction, and in some cases during the execution of an instruction, but they are not in general caused by the instruction concerned.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>&#8226; MemManage and BusFault exceptions are listed for all instructions that perform explicit data memory accesses.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; All instruction fetches can cause MemManage and BusFault exceptions. These are not caused by execution of the instruction and so are not listed.</FONT><BR><FONT class=extract>&#8226; UsageFault exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons and are listed against instructions as appropriate.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; UsageFault exceptions also occur when pseudocode indicates that the instruction is UNDEFINED. These UsageFaults are not listed.</FONT><BR>&#8226; The SVCall exception is listed for the SVC instruction.<BR><FONT class=extract>&#8226; The DebugMonitor exception is listed for the BKPT instruction.<BR></FONT><FONT class=extract>&#8226; HardFault exceptions can arise from escalation of faults listed against an instruction, but are not themselves listed.</FONT><BR>Note<BR>For a summary of the different types of MemManage, BusFault and UsageFault exceptions see Fault behavior on page B1-669.
