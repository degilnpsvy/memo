B3.4 Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller, NVIC</P>
<P>ARMv7-M provides an interrupt controller as an integral part of the ARMv7-M exception model. The interrupt controller operation aligns with the ARM General Interrupt Controller (GIC) specification, defined for use with other ARMv7 profiles and other architectures.</P>
<P>The ARMv7-M NVIC architecture supports up to 496 interrupts. The number of external interrupt lines supported can be determined from the read-only Interrupt Controller Type Register (ICTR) accessed at address 0xE000E004 in the System Control Space. See Interrupt Controller Type Register, ICTR on page B3-741 for the register detail. The general registers associated with the NVIC are all accessible from a block of memory in the System Control Space as described in Table B3-35 on page B3-753.
