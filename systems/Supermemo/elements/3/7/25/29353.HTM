B3.3 The system timer, SysTick
<P></P>
<P>An ARMv7-M implementation must include a system timer, SysTick, that provides a simple, 24-bit clear-on-write, decrementing, wrap-on-zero counter with a flexible control mechanism. A system can use this counter in several different ways, including:<BR>&#8226; As an RTOS tick timer that fires at a programmable rate, for example 100Hz, and invokes a SysTick routine each time it fires.<BR>&#8226; As a high speed alarm timer using the main processor clock.<BR>&#8226; As a variable rate alarm or signal timer. The available duration range depends on the reference clock used and the dynamic range of the counter.<BR>&#8226; As a simple counter. Software can use this to measure time to completion and time used.<BR>&#8226; As an internal clock source control based on missing or meeting durations. Software can use the COUNTFLAG field in the control and status register to determine whether an action completed within a particular duration, as part of a dynamic clock management control loop.
