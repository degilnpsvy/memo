The stack pointer, SP, banks SP_main and SP_process. The current stack depends on the <FONT class=clozed>mode and, in Thread mode, the value of the CONTROL.SPSEL bit, see The special-purpose CONTROL register on page B1-628. A reset selects and initializes SP_main, see Reset behavior on page B1-641.</FONT>
