Lockup is a PE state where the PE stops executing instructions in response to an error for which <FONT class=clozed>escalation to an appropriate HardFault handler is not possible because of the current execution priority. An example is a synchronous exception that would escalate to a Secure HardFault, but that cannot escalate to a Secure HardFault because Secure HardFault is already active.</FONT>
