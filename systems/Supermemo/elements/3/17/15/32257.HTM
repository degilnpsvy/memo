For a PE, the following mechanisms are treated as independent observers:<BR><FONT class=clozed>&#8226; The mechanism that performs reads from or writes to memory.<BR>&#8226; The mechanism that causes an instruction cache to be filled from memory or that fetches instructions to be executed directly from memory. These accesses are treated as reads.</FONT>
