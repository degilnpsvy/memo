Store operations are single-copy atomic if, when they overlap bytes in memory:<BR>1. All of the writes from one of the stores are inserted into the coherence order of each overlapping byte.<BR>2. All of the writes from another of the stores are inserted into the coherence order of each overlapping byte.<BR>3. Step 2 repeats, for each single-copy store atomic operation that overlaps.
