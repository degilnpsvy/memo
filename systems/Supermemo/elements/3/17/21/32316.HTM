The IDT format is similar to that of the GDT and the LDTs examined in <A title="Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Memory Addressing" class=link href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/understanding-the-linux/0596002130/ch02.html">Chapter 2</A>. Each entry corresponds to an interrupt or an exception vector and consists of an 8-byte descriptor. Thus, a maximum of 256 &#215; 8 = 2048 bytes are required to store the IDT.
