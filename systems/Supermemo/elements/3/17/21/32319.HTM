The <A class=ulink href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/" target=_top>GNU libiconv library</A> is needed to build GLib if your system doesn't have the <CODE class=function>iconv()</CODE> function for doing conversion between character encodings. Most modern systems should have <CODE class=function>iconv()</CODE>, however many older systems lack an <CODE class=function>iconv()</CODE> implementation. On such systems, you must install the libiconv library. This can be found at: <A class=ulink href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv" target=_top>http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv</A>.

<P>If your system has an <CODE class=function>iconv()</CODE> implementation but you want to use libiconv instead, you can pass the --with-libiconv option to configure. This forces libiconv to be used. </P>
<P>Note that if you have libiconv installed in your default include search path (for instance, in <CODE class=filename>/usr/local/</CODE>), but don't enable it, you will get an error while compiling GLib because the <CODE class=filename>iconv.h</CODE> that libiconv installs hides the system iconv. </P>
<P>If you are using the native iconv implementation on Solaris instead of libiconv, you'll need to make sure that you have the converters between locale encodings and UTF-8 installed. At a minimum you'll need the SUNWuiu8 package. You probably should also install the SUNWciu8, SUNWhiu8, SUNWjiu8, and SUNWkiu8 packages. </P>
<P>The native iconv on Compaq Tru64 doesn't contain support for UTF-8, so you'll need to use GNU libiconv instead. (When using GNU libiconv for GLib, you'll need to use GNU libiconv for GNU gettext as well.) This probably applies to related operating systems as well.
