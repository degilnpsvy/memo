The recommended way of using GLib has always been to only include the toplevel headers <CODE class=filename>glib.h</CODE>, <CODE class=filename>glib-object.h</CODE>, <CODE class=filename>gio.h</CODE>. Starting with 2.32, GLib enforces this by generating an error when individual headers are directly included.
