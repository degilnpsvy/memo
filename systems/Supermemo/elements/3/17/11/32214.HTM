LDC, LDM, LDRD, POP, PUSH, STC, STRD, STM, VLDM, VPOP, VPUSH, VSTM, VLDR.64, and VSTR.64 instructions access a sequence of words at increasing memory addresses, effectively incrementing the address by 4 for each load or store. If this calculation overflows the top of the address space, the result is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
