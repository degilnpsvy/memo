<H3>Security</H3>
<P>When writing code that runs with elevated privileges, it is important to follow some basic rules of secure programming. David Wheeler has an excellent book on this topic, <A class=ulink href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/index.html" target=_top>Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO</A>. </P>
<P>When it comes to GLib and its associated libraries, GLib and GObject are generally fine to use in code that runs with elevated privileges; they don't load modules (executable code in shared objects) or run other programs 'behind your back'. <FONT class=extract>GIO has to be used carefully in privileged programs, see the </FONT><A class=ulink href="https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/ch02.html" target=_top><FONT class=extract>GIO documentation</FONT></A><FONT class=extract> for details.</FONT>
