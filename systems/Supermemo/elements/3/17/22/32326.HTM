<B><CODE class=systemitem>--disable-Bsymbolic</CODE> and <CODE class=systemitem>--enable-Bsymbolic</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> By default, GLib uses the -Bsymbolic-functions linker flag to avoid intra-library PLT jumps. A side-effect of this is that it is no longer possible to override internal uses of GLib functions with <CODE class=envar>LD_PRELOAD</CODE>. Therefore, it may make sense to turn this feature off in some situations. The <CODE class=option>--disable-Bsymbolic</CODE> option allows to do that.
