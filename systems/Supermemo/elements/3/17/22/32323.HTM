<B><CODE class=systemitem>--enable-debug</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> Turns on various amounts of debugging support. Setting this to 'no' disables g_assert(), g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail() and all cast checks between different object types. Setting it to 'minimum' disables only cast checks. Setting it to 'yes' enables <A title=G_DEBUG class=link href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-running.html#G-DEBUG:CAPS">runtime debugging</A>. The default is 'minimum'. Note that 'no' is fast, but dangerous as it tends to destabilize even mostly bug-free software by changing the effect of many bugs from simple warnings into fatal crashes. Thus <CODE class=option>--enable-debug=no</CODE> should <SPAN class=emphasis><EM>not</EM></SPAN> be used for stable releases of GLib.
