&nbsp; &#8226; The base register is restored to the original value, and:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; If the instruction is in an IT block, the PE uses instruction restart.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; If the instruction is not in an IT block, and the PE takes the exception after it loads the base register, EPSR.ICI can be set to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value that will load at least the base register and subsequent locations again after returning from the interrupt.
