<H3 class=docSection1Title>1.1. What Is Software Construction?</H3>
<P class=docText>Developing computer software can be a complicated process, and in the last 25 years, researchers have identified numerous distinct activities that go into software development. They include</P>

<P class=docText>If you've worked on informal projects, you might think that this list represents a lot of red tape. If you've worked on projects that are too formal, you <SPAN class=docEmphasis>know</SPAN> that this list represents a lot of red tape! It's hard to strike a balance between too little and too much formality, and that's discussed later in the book.</P>
<P class=docText>If you've taught yourself to program or worked mainly on informal projects, you might not have made distinctions among the many activities that go into creating a software product. Mentally, you might have grouped all of these activities together as "programming." If you work on informal projects, the main activity you think of when you think about creating software is probably the activity the researchers refer to as "construction."</P>
<P class=docText>This intuitive notion of "construction" is fairly accurate, but it suffers from a lack of perspective. Putting construction in its context with other activities helps keep the focus on the right tasks during construction and appropriately emphasizes important nonconstruction activities. <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/memo/memo/srcs/Microsoft.Press.Code.Complete.Second.Edition/0735619670/ch01lev1sec1.html#ch01fig01">Figure 1-1</A> illustrates construction's place related to other software-development activities.</P><A name=ch01fig01></A>

If this were a book about all aspects of software development, it would feature nicely balanced discussions of all activities in the development process. Because this is a handbook of construction techniques, however, it places a lopsided emphasis on construction and only touches on related topics. If this book were a dog, it would nuzzle up to construction, wag its tail at design and testing, and bark at the other development activities.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>
<P class=docText>Construction is also sometimes known as "coding" or "programming." "Coding" isn't really the best word because it implies the mechanical translation of a preexisting design into a computer language; construction is not at all mechanical and involves substantial creativity and judgment. Throughout the book, I use "programming" interchangeably with "construction."</P>

<P class=docText>For an even fuller list of construction activities, look through the chapter titles in the table of contents.</P>
<P class=docText>With so many activities at work in construction, you might say, "OK, Jack, what activities are <SPAN class=docEmphasis>not</SPAN> part of construction?" That's a fair question. Important nonconstruction activities include management, requirements development, software architecture, user-interface design, system testing, and maintenance. Each of these activities affects the ultimate success of a project as much as construction&#8212;at least the success of any project that calls for more than one or two people and lasts longer than a few weeks. You can find good books on each activity; many are listed in the "<A class=docLink href="file:///D:/memo/memo/srcs/Microsoft.Press.Code.Complete.Second.Edition/0735619670/ch24lev1sec6.html#ch24lev1sec6">Additional Resources</A>" sections throughout the book and in <A class=docLink href="file:///D:/memo/memo/srcs/Microsoft.Press.Code.Complete.Second.Edition/0735619670/ch35.html#ch35">Chapter 35</A>, "<A class=docLink href="file:///D:/memo/memo/srcs/Microsoft.Press.Code.Complete.Second.Edition/0735619670/ch35.html#ch35">Where to Find More Information</A>," at the end of the book.
