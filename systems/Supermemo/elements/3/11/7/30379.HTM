D1.2.145 <FONT class=extract>MMFAR, MemManage Fault Address Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The MMFAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Shows the address of the memory location that caused an MPU fault.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED34.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via MMFAR_NS located at 0xE002ED34. The location 0xE002ED34 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P>Field descriptions<BR>The MMFAR bit assignments are:<BR><FONT class=extract>ADDRESS, bits [31:0]<BR>Data address for an MemManage fault. This register is updated with the address of a location that produced a MemManage fault. The MMFSR shows the cause of the fault, and whether this field is valid. This field is valid only when MMFSR.MMARVALID is set, otherwise it is UNKNOWN.<BR>In implementations without unique BFAR and MMFAR registers, the value of this register is UNKNOWN if BFSR.BFARVALID is set.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT>
