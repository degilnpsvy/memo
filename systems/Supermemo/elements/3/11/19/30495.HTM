B8.2 Security attribution 
<P></P>
<P>RJGHS The Security Extension defines three levels of memory security attribution. In ascending order of security, these are:<BR>1. Non-secure.<BR>2. Secure and Non-secure callable.<BR>3. Secure and not Non-secure callable.<BR>RRPKG The following units can provide security attribution information:<BR>&#8226; A security attribution unit (SAU) inside the PE.<BR>&#8226; An implementation defined attribution unit (IDAU) external to the PE. The presence of such a unit is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.<BR>RMGXN <FONT class=extract>The attribution information from the SAU is used unless the IDAU specifies attributes with a higher security, in which case the IDAU attributes override the SAU attributes. This rule does not apply to architecturally defined ranges exempt from memory attribution.</FONT><BR>RNJGR <FONT class=extract>An attribution unit (AU) violation is defined as being a violation raised by either the SAU or the IDAU.</FONT><BR>RQGVS All boundaries between address ranges with different security attributes must be aligned to 32-byte boundaries.<BR>RBLJT <FONT class=extract>The behavior of the following address ranges is fixed, so they are exempt from memory attribution by both the SAU and IDAU:<BR>0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF<BR>&nbsp; If the PE implements the Security Extension, this memory range is always marked as Secure and not Non-secure callable for instruction fetches.<BR>&nbsp; If the Security Extension is not present, this range is marked as Non-secure.<BR>Ranges exempt from checking security violation<BR>&nbsp; The following address ranges are marked with the Security state indicated by NS-Req, that is, the current state of the PE for non-debug accesses. This marking sets the NS-Attr to NS-Req:<BR>&nbsp; 0xE0000000 - 0xE0002FFF: ITM, DWT, FPB.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE000E000 - 0xE000EFFF: SCS range.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE002E000 - 0xE002EFFF: SCS NS alias range.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE0040000 - 0xE0041FFF: TPIU, ETM.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE00FF000 - 0xE00FFFFF: ROM table.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE0000000 - 0xEFFFFFFF for instruction fetch only.<BR>&nbsp; Additional address ranges specified by the IDAU.</FONT><BR>RVPWL The Security attribution and MPU check sequence is shown in the following diagram.<BR>See also:<BR>&#8226; Security attribution unit (SAU) on page B8-178.<BR>&#8226; IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED Attribution Unit (IDAU) on page B8-179.
