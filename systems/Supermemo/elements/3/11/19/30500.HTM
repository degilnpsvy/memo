The MPU is restricted in how it can change the default memory map attributes associated with System space, that is, for addresses 0xE0000000 and higher, in the following ways:<BR>&#8226; System space is always XN.<BR>&#8226; The MPU can map system space regions that default to Device-nGnRE to Device-nGnRnE.<BR>&#8226; The effect of remapping a System space region that defaults to Device memory as Normal memory is UNPREDICTABLE.
