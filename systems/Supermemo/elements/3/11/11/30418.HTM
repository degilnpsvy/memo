the memory accesses associated with an instruction fetch do not normally cause AUVIOL SecureFault&#8217;s to be raised, even if the processor is in the non-secure state. However opcodes that span the boundary between a non-secure and a secure region cause an INVTRAN or INVEP SecureFault. Similarly other types of invalid instruction fetch can also raise INVTRAN or INVEP SecureFault&#8217;s
