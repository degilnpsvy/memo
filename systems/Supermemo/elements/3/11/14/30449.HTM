IT/ICI, bits [15:10, 26:25]<BR>If-then and interrupt continuation. Depending on value, this field encodes either the current condition and position in an IT block sequence, or information on the outstanding register list for an interrupted exception-continuable multi-cycle load or store instruction.<BR>The field IT[7:0] is equivalent to EPSR[15:10,26:25]. The field ICI[7:0] is equivalent to EPSR[26:25,15:10].<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
