<P></P>
<P>The SAU_TYPE characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Indicates the number of regions implemented by the Security Attribution Unit.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EDD4.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI when accessed as Non-secure.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The SAU_TYPE bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR><FONT class=extract>SREGION, bits [7:0]<BR>SAU regions. The number of implemented SAU regions.<BR>If this field is RAZ, the SAU behaves as follows:<BR>&#8226; SAU_CTRL.ENABLE behaves as RAZ/WI.<BR>&#8226; It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether SAU_CTRL.ALLNS behaves as RAO/WI and all attribution is performed by the IDAU.<BR>&#8226; SAU_RNR, SAU_RBAR, and SAU_RLAR behave as RAZ/WI.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</FONT>
