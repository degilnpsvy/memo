To define the instruction access rights to a memory region, the memory attributes describe, separately, for the region:<BR>&#8226; its read access rights<BR>&#8226; whether it is suitable for execution. 
<P></P>
<P>For example, a region that is accessible for execution by Privileged processes has the memory attributes:<BR>&#8226; accessible only to Privileged read accesses<BR>&#8226; suitable for execution.</P>
<P>This means there is some linkage between the memory attributes that define the accessibility of a region to explicit memory accesses, and those that define that a region can be executed.</P>
<P>A <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> occurs if a processor attempts to execute code from a memory location with attributes that do not permit code execution.</P>
<P>Note<BR>Instruction access control is fully supported when a Memory Protection Unit is implemented and enabled, see Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7 on page B3-761.<BR>Instruction execution access control is also supported in the default address map, see The system address map on page B3-704.
