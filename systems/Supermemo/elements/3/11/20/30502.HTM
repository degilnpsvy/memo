The behavior of the following address ranges is fixed, so they are exempt from memory attribution by both the SAU and IDAU:<BR>0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF<BR>&nbsp; If the PE implements the Security Extension, this memory range is always marked as Secure and not Non-secure callable for instruction fetches.<BR>&nbsp; If the Security Extension is not present, this range is marked as Non-secure.<BR>Ranges exempt from checking security violation<BR>&nbsp; The following address ranges are marked with the Security state indicated by NS-Req, that is, the current state of the PE for non-debug accesses. This marking sets the NS-Attr to NS-Req:<BR>&nbsp; 0xE0000000 - 0xE0002FFF: ITM, DWT, FPB.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE000E000 - 0xE000EFFF: SCS range.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE002E000 - 0xE002EFFF: SCS NS alias range.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE0040000 - 0xE0041FFF: TPIU, ETM.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE00FF000 - 0xE00FFFFF: ROM table.<BR>&nbsp; 0xE0000000 - 0xEFFFFFFF for instruction fetch only.<BR>&nbsp; Additional address ranges specified by the IDAU.
