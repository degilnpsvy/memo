The IDAU can provide the following security attribution information for an address:<BR>&#8226; Security attribution exempt. This specifies that the address is exempt from security attribution. This information is combined with the address ranges that are architecturally required to be exempt from attribution,<BR>&#8226; Non-secure. This specifies if the address is Secure or Non-secure.<BR>&#8226; Non-secure callable. This specifies if code at the address can be called from Non-secure state. This attribute is only valid if the address is marked as Secure.<BR>&#8226; Region number. This is the region number that matches the address, and is only used by the TT instruction.<BR>&#8226; Region number valid. This specifies that the region number is valid. This field has no effect on the attribution of the address, and is only used by the TT instruction.
