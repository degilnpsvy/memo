D1.2.11 <FONT class=extract>CFSR, Configurable Fault Status Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The CFSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>Contains the three Configurable Fault Status Registers</FONT>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword, and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000ED28.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED28. The location 0xE002ED28 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states on a bit by bit basis.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>The CFSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>UFSR, bits [31:16]<BR>UsageFault Status Register. Provides information on UsageFault exceptions.<BR>This field is banked between Security states.<BR>See UFSR.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>BFSR, bits [15:8]<BR>BusFault Status Register. Provides information on BusFault exceptions.<BR>This field is not banked between Security states.<BR>See BFSR.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>MMFSR, bits [7:0]<BR>MemManage Fault Status Register. Provides information on MemManage exceptions.<BR>This field is banked between Security states.<BR>See MMFSR.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
