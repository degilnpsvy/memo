D1.2.17 CSSELR, Cache Size Selection Register</P>
<P>The CSSELR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Selects the current Cache Size ID Register, CCSIDR, by specifying the required cache level and the cache type (either instruction or data cache)<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED84.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CSSELR_NS located at 0xE002ED84. The location 0xE002ED84 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The CSSELR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:4]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>Level, bits [3:1]<BR>Cache level. Selects which cache level is to be identified. Permitted values are from 0b000, indicating Level 1 cache, to 0b110 indicating Level 7 cache.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b000 Level 1 cache.<BR>0b001 Level 2 cache.<BR>0b010 Level 3 cache.<BR>0b011 Level 4 cache.<BR>0b100 Level 5 cache.<BR>0b101 Level 6 cache.<BR>0b110 Level 7 cache.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>InD, bit [0]<BR>Instruction not data. Selects whether the instruction or the data cache is to be identified.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Data or unified cache.<BR>1 Instruction cache.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.
