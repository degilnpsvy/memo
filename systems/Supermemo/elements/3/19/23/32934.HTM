D1.2.12 CLIDR, Cache Level ID Register</P>
<P>The CLIDR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Identifies the type of caches implemented and the level of coherency and unification.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED78.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CLIDR_NS located at 0xE002ED78. The location 0xE002ED78 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The CLIDR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>ICB, bits [31:30]<BR>Inner cache boundary. This field indicates the boundary between inner and outer domain.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b00 Not disclosed in this mechanism.<BR>0b01 L1 cache is the highest inner level.<BR>0b10 L2 cache is the highest inner level.<BR>0b11 L3 cache is the highest inner level.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>LoUU, bits [29:27]<BR>Level of Unification Uniprocessor. This field indicates the Level of Unification Uniprocessor for the cache hierarchy.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>LoC, bits [26:24]<BR>Level of Coherence. This field indicates the Level of Coherence for the cache hierarchy.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>LoUIS, bits [23:21]<BR>Level of Unification Inner Shareable. This field indicates the Level of Unification shareable for the cache hierarchy.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>Ctypem, bits [3(m-1)+2:3(m-1)], for m = 1-7<BR>Cache type field m. Indicates the type of cache implemented at level m.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b000 No cache.<BR>0b001 Instruction cache only.<BR>0b010 Data cache only.<BR>0b011 Separate instruction and data caches.<BR>0b100 Unified cache.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>If software reads the Cache Type fields from Ctype1 upwards, when it has seen a value of 000, no caches exist at further-out levels of the hierarchy. So, for example, if Ctype3 is the first Cache Type field with a value of 000, the values of Ctype4 to Ctype7 must be ignored.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
