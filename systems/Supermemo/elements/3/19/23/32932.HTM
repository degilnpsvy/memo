D1.2.10 <FONT class=extract>CCSIDR, Current Cache Size ID register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The CCSIDR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>The CCSIDR provides information about the architecture of the currently selected cache</FONT>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If CSSELR points to an unimplemented cache, the value of this register is UNKNOWN.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED80.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CCSIDR_NS located at 0xE002ED80. The location 0xE002ED80 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</P>
<P>Preface<BR>Provides indirect read access to the architecture of the cache currently selected by CSSELR.</P>
<P>The CCSIDR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>WT, bit [31]<BR>Write-Through. Indicates whether the currently selected cache level supports Write-Through.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Not supported.<BR>1 Supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>WB, bit [30]<BR>Writeback. Indicates whether the currently selected cache level supports writeback.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Not supported.<BR>1 Supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>RA, bit [29]<BR>Read-allocate. Indicates whether the currently selected cache level supports read-allocation.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Not supported.<BR>1 Supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>WA, bit [28]<BR>Write-Allocate. Indicates whether the currently selected cache level supports write-allocation.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Not supported.<BR>1 Supported.<BR>This bit reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>NumSets, bits [27:13]<BR>Number of sets. Indicates (Number of sets in the currently selected cache) - 1. Therefore, a value of 0 indicates that 1 is set in the cache. The number of sets does not have to be a power of 2.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</P>
<P>LineSize, bits [2:0]<BR>Line size. Indicates (Log2(Number of words per line in the currently selected cache)) - 2.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
