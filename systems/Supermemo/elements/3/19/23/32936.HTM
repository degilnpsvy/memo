D1.2.15 CPPWR, Coprocessor Power Control Register</P>
<P>The CPPWR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Specifies whether coprocessors are permitted to enter a non-retentive power state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000E00C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CPPWR_NS located at 0xE002E00C. The location 0xE002E00C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The CPPWR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:24]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SUS11, bit [23]<BR>State UNKNOWN Secure only 11. The value in this field is ignored. If SUS11 is RAZ/WI this field is also RAZ/WI. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the SUS10 field, then the value is UNKNOWN.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>SU11, bit [22]<BR>State UNKNOWN 11. The value in this field is ignored. If SUS11 is RAZ/WI this field is also RAZ/WI. If the value of this bit is not programmed to the same value as the SU10 field, then the<BR>value is UNKNOWN.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>SUS10, bit [21]<BR>State UNKNOWN Secure only 10. This bit indicates and allows modification of whether the SU10<BR>field can be modified from Non-secure state.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The SU10 field is accessible from both Security states.<BR>1 The SU10 field is only accessible from the Secure state.<BR>If SU10 is always RAZ/WI this field is also RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>SU10, bit [20]<BR>State UNKNOWN 10. This bit indicates and allows modification of whether the state associated with the floating-point unit is permitted to become UNKNOWN. This can be used as a hint to power control logic that the floating-point unit might be powered down.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The floating-point state is not permitted to become UNKNOWN.<BR>1 The floating-point state is permitted to become UNKNOWN.<BR>When SUS10 is set to 1, the Non-secure view of this bit is RAZ/WI. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this bit is always RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [19:16]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SUSm, bit [2m+1], for m = 0-7<BR>State UNKNOWN Secure only m. This field indicates and allows modification of whether the SUm field can be modified from Non-secure state.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0 The SUm field is accessible from both Security states.<BR>1 The SUm field is only accessible from the Secure state.<BR>If SUm is always RAZ/WI this field is also RAZ/WI.<BR>This field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>SUm, bit [2m], for m = 0-7<BR>State UNKNOWN m. This field indicates and allows modification of whether the state associated with coprocessor m is permitted to become UNKNOWN. This can be used as a hint to power control logic that the coprocessor might be powered down.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0 The coprocessor state is not permitted to become UNKNOWN.<BR>1 The coprocessor state is permitted to become UNKNOWN.<BR>When SUSm is set to 1, the Non-secure view of this bit is RAZ/WI. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this bit is always RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
