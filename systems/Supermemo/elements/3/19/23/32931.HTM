D1.2.6 BFAR, BusFault Address Register
<P></P>
<P>The BFAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Shows the address associated with a precise data access BusFault.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED38.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via BFAR_NS located at 0xE002ED38. The location 0xE002ED38 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>Preface<BR>The Non-secure version of this register is RAZ/WI if AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set to 0.</P>
<P>The BFAR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>ADDRESS, bits [31:0]<BR>Data address for a precise BusFault. This register is updated with the address of a location that produced a BusFault. The BFSR shows the reason for the fault. This field is valid only when BFSR.BFARVALID is set, otherwise it is UNKNOWN.<BR>In implementations without unique BFAR and MMFAR registers, the value of this register is UNKNOWN if MMFSR.MMARVALID is set.<BR>If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero this field is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.<BR>Note<BR>If an implementation shares a common BFAR and MMFAR it must not leak Secure state information to the Non-secure state. One possible implementation is that BFAR shares resource with the Secure MMFAR if AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero, and with the Non-secure MMFAR if AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set.
