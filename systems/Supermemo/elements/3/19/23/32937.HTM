D1.2.16 CPUID, CPUID Base Register 
<P></P>
<P>The CPUID characteristics are:<BR>Purpose:<FONT class=clozed> Provides identification information for the PE, including an implementer code for the device and a device ID number.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000ED00.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via CPUID_NS located at 0xE002ED00. The location 0xE002ED00 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The CPUID bit assignments are:</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Implementer, bits [31:24]<BR>Implementer code. This field must hold an implementer code that has been assigned by ARM.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x41 'A': ARM Limited.<BR>Not 0x41 Implementer other than ARM Limited.<BR>ARM can assign codes that are not published in this manual. All values not assigned by ARM are reserved and must not be used.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Variant, bits [23:20]<BR>Variant number. IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED variant number. Typically, this field is used to distinguish between different product variants, or major revisions of a product.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Architecture, bits [19:16]<BR>Architecture version. Defines the Architecture implemented by the PE.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b1100 ARMv8-M architecture without Main Extension.<BR>0b1111 ARMv8-M architecture with Main Extension.<BR>All other values are reserved.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>PartNo, bits [15:4]<BR>Part number. IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED primary part number for the device.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Revision, bits [3:0]<BR>Revision number. IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED revision number for the device.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value</FONT>.
