D1.2.55 DWT_CPICNT, DWT CPI Count Register 
<P></P>
<P>The DWT_CPICNT characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Counts additional cycles required to execute multicycle instructions and instruction fetch stalls.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 1.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0001008.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DWT_CPICNT bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>CPICNT, bits [7:0]<BR>Base instruction overhead counter.<BR>Counts one on each cycle when all of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; DWT_CTRL.CPIEVTENA == 1 and DEMCR.TRCENA == 1.<BR>&#8226; No instruction is executed.<BR>&#8226; No load-store operation is in progress, see DWT_LSUCNT.<BR>&#8226; No exception-entry or exception-exit operation is in progress, see DWT_EXCCNT.<BR>&#8226; The PE is not in a power-saving mode, see DWT_SLEEPCNT.<BR>&#8226; Either SecureNoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE, or the PE is in Non-secure state and NoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE.<BR>The definition of "no instruction is executed" is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. ARM recommends that this counts each cycle on which no instruction is retired.<BR>Initialized to zero when the counter is disabled and DWT_CTRL.CPIEVTENA is written with 1. An Event Counter packet is emitted on counter overflow.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Cold reset.
