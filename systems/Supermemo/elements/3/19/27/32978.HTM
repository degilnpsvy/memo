D1.2.53 DWT_CIDR3, DWT Component Identification Register 3</P>
<P>The DWT_CIDR3 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the DWT.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0001FFC.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DWT_CIDR3 bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>PRMBL_3, bits [7:0]<BR>CoreSight component identification preamble. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as 0xB1.
