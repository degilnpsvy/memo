D1.2.49 <FONT class=extract>DSCSR, Debug Security Control and Status Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The DSCSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides control and status information for Secure debug.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; Writes to this register while the PE is in Non-debug state are ignored.<BR>&nbsp; This register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 to software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Security Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Security Extension is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if Halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EE08.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DSCSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:18]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>CDSKEY, bit [17]<BR>CDS write-enable key. Writes to the CDS bit are ignored unless CDSKEY is concurrently written to zero.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Concurrent write to CDS not ignored.<BR>1 Concurrent write to CDS ignored.<BR>This bit reads-as-one.</P>
<P>CDS, bit [16]<BR>Current domain Secure. This field indicates the current Security state of the processor.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 PE is in Non-secure state.<BR>1 PE is in Secure state.<BR>This bit is only writeable if DHCSR.S_SDE is 1, the access to the register originates from the debugger, the PE is halted in Debug state, and CDSKEY is concurrently written to zero.</P>
<P>Bits [15:2]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SBRSEL, bit [1]<BR>Secure Banked register select. If SBRSELEN is 1 this bit selects whether the Non-secure or the Secure version of the memory-mapped banked registers are accessible to the debugger.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Selects the Non-secure versions.<BR>1 Selects the Secure versions.<BR>This bit behaves as RAZ/WI if DHCSR.S_SDE is 0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.</P>
<P>SBRSELEN, bit [0]<BR>Secure Banked register select enable. Controls whether the SBRSEL field or the current Security state of the processor selects which version of the memory-mapped banked registers are accessed to the debugger.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The current Security state of the PE determines which memory-mapped banked registers are accessed by the debugger.<BR>1 DSCSR.SBRSEL selects which memory-mapped banked registers are accessed by the debugger.<BR>This bit behaves as RAO/WI if DHCSR.S_SDE is 0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.<BR>Note<BR>This method of banked register selection means that the register aliasing is not used for accesses from the debugger. Accesses to the aliased addresses from the debugger have the same behavior as reserved addresses.
