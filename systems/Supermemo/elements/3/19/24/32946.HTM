D1.2.25 <FONT class=extract>DCCSW, Data Cache Clean line by Set/Way</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The DCCSW characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>Clean data or unified cache line by set/way.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit write-only register located at 0xE000EF6C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DCCSW_NS located at 0xE002EF6C. The location 0xE002EF6C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The DCCSW bit assignments are:<BR>SetWay, bits [31:4]<BR>Cache set/way. Contains two fields: Way, bits [31:32-A], the number of the way to operate on. Set, bits [B-1:L], the number of the set to operate on. Bits [L-1:4] are RES0. A = Log2(ASSOCIATIVITY), L = Log2(LINELEN), B = (L + S), S = Log2(NSETS). ASSOCIATIVITY, LINELEN (line length, in bytes), and NSETS (number of sets) have their usual meanings and are the values for the cache level being operated on. The values of A and S are rounded up to the next integer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Level, bits [3:1]<BR>Cache level. Cache level to operate on, minus 1. For example, this field is 0 for operations on L1 cache, or 1 for operations on L2 cache.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Bit [0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</FONT>
