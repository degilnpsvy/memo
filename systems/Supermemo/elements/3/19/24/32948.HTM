D1.2.27 DCIDR1, SCS Component Identification Register 1</P>
<P>The DCIDR1 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the SCS.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if Halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EFF4.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DCIDR1_NS located at 0xE002EFF4. The location 0xE002EFF4 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
