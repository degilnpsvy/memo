D1.2.80 FPCAR, Floating-Point Context Address Register</P>
<P>The FPCAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds the location of the unpopulated floating-point register space allocated on an exception stack frame.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Floating-point Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Floating-point Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EF38.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via FPCAR_NS located at 0xE002EF38. The location 0xE002EF38 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FPCAR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>ADDRESS, bits [31:3]<BR>Address. The location of the unpopulated floating-point register space allocated on an exception stack frame.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [2:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
