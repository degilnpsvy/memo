D1.2.82 FPDSCR, Floating-Point Default Status Control Register</P>
<P>The FPDSCR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds the default values for the floating-point status control data that the PE assigns to the FPSCR when it creates a new floating-point context.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Floating-point Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Floating-point Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000EF3C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via FPDSCR_NS located at 0xE002EF3C. The location 0xE002EF3C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FPDSCR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:27]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>AHP, bit [26]<BR>Alternative half-precision. Default value for FPSCR.AHP.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>DN, bit [25]<BR>Default NaN. Default value for FPSCR.DN.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>FZ, bit [24]<BR>Flush-to-zero. Default value for FPSCR.FZ.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>RMode, bits [23:22]<BR>Rounding mode. Default value for FPSCR.RMode.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [21:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
