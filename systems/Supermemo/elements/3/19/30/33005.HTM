D1.2.83 FPSCR, Floating-point Status and Control Register</P>
<P>The FPSCR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides control of the floating-point system.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access only. Unprivileged access is RAZ/WI.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Floating-point Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Floating-point Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>Preface<BR>Writes to the FPSCR can have side-effects on various aspects of processor operation. All of these side-effects are synchronous to the FPSCR write. This means that they are guaranteed not to be visible to earlier instructions in the execution stream, and they are guaranteed to be visible to later instructions in the execution stream.</P>
<P>The FPSCR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>N, bit [31]<BR>Negative condition flag.
