D1.2.79 FNC_RETURN, Function Return Payload 
<P></P>
<P>The FNC_RETURN characteristics are:<BR>Purpose:<FONT class=clozed> Value provided in LR on entry to Non-secure state from a Secure BLXN</FONT>S.<BR>Usage constraints: None.<BR>Configurations: All.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit payload.</P>
<P>The FNC_RETURN bit assignments are:</P>
<P>PREFIX, bits [31:24]<BR>This field reads as 0b11111110.</P>
<P>ONES, bits [23:1]<BR>This field reads as 0b11111111111111111111111.</P>
<P>S, bit [0]<BR>Secure. Indicates whether the function call was from the Non-secure or Secure state. Because FNC_RETURN is only used when calling from the Secure state, this bit is always set to 1. However, some function chaining cases can result in an SG instruction clearing this bit, so the architecture ignores the state of this bit when processing a branch to FNC_RETURN.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 From Secure state.<BR>1 From Non-secure state.
