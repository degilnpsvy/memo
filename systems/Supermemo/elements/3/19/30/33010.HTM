D1.2.88 FP_COMP&lt;n&gt;, Flash Patch Comparator Register, n = 0 - 141
<P></P>
<P>The FP_COMP&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds an address for comparison. The effect of the match depends on the configuration of the FPB and whether the comparator is an instruction address comparator or a literal address comparator.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the FPB is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the FPB is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0002008 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The FP_COMP&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:<BR>When BE==0: FE, RES0, FPADDR, BE<BR>When BE==1: BPADDR BE</P>
<P>BPADDR, bits [31:1], when BE==1<BR>Breakpoint address. Specifies bits[31:1] of the breakpoint instruction address.</P>
<P>FE, bit [31], when BE==0<BR>Flash Patch enable. Specifies if Flash Patch enabled.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Flash Patch disabled.<BR>1 Flash Patch enabled.</P>
<P>Bits [30:29], when BE==0<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>FPADDR, bits [28:2], when BE==0<BR>Flash Patch address. Specifies bits[28:2] of the Flash Patch address.</P>
<P>Bit [1], when BE==0<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>BE, bit [0]<BR>Breakpoint enable. Selects between Flash Patch and breakpoint functionality.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Breakpoint disabled, Flash Patch mode selected.<BR>1 Breakpoint enabled, Flash Patch mode de-selected.<BR>The comparator can be completely disabled by writing the entire register to zero.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.
