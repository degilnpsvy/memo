This macro is defined if the atomic operations of GLib are implemented using real hardware atomic operations. This means that the GLib atomic API can be used between processes and safely mixed with other (hardware) atomic APIs.

<P>If this macro is not defined, the atomic operations may be emulated using a mutex. In that case, the GLib atomic operations are only atomic relative to themselves and within a single process.
