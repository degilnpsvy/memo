D1.2.4 <FONT class=extract>APSR, Application Program Status Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The APSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides privileged and unprivileged access to the PE Execution state fields.<BR>Usage constraints: Both privileged and unprivileged access permitted.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>The APSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>N, bit [31]<BR>Negative condition flag. When updated by a flag setting instruction this bit indicates whether the result of the operation when treated as a two's complement signed integer is negative.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Result is positive or zero.<BR>1 Result is negative.<BR>See individual instruction pages for details.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Z, bit [30]<BR>Zero condition flag. When updated by a flag setting instruction this bit indicates whether the result of the operation was zero.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Result is non-zero.<BR>1 Result is zero.<BR>See individual instruction pages for details.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>C, bit [29]<BR>Carry Condition flag. When updated by a flag setting instruction this bit indicates whether the operation resulted in an unsigned overflow or whether the last bit shifted out of the result was set.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No carry occurred, or last bit shifted was clear.<BR>1 Carry occurred, or last bit shifted was set.<BR>See individual instruction pages for details.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>V, bit [28]<BR>Overflow condition flag. When updated by a flag setting instruction this bit indicates whether a signed overflow occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Signed overflow did not occur.<BR>1 Signed overflow occurred.<BR>See individual instruction pages for details.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Q, bit [27]<BR>Sticky saturation flag. When updated by certain instructions this bit indicates either that an overflow occurred or that the result was saturated. This bit is cumulative and can only be cleared to zero by software.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Saturation or overflow has not occurred since bit was last cleared.<BR>1 Saturation or overflow has occurred since bit was last cleared.<BR>See individual instruction pages for details.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P>Bits [26:20]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>GE, bits [19:16]<BR>Greater than or equal flags. When updated by parallel addition and subtraction instructions these bits record whether the result was greater than or equal to zero. SEL instructions use these bits to determine which register to select a particular byte from.<BR>See individual instruction pages for details.<BR>If the DSP Extension is not implemented, this field is RES0.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P>Bits [15:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
