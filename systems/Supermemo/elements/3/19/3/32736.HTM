The older deprecation mechanism of hiding deprecated interfaces entirely from the compiler by using the preprocessor symbol G_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is still used for deprecated macros, enumeration values, etc. To detect uses of these in your code, use the commandline option <CODE class=literal>-DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED</CODE>.
