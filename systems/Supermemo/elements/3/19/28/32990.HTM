D1.2.65 DWT_LSUCNT, DWT LSU Count Register</P>
<P>The DWT_LSUCNT characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Increments on the additional cycles required to execute all load or store instructions.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Present only if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 0.<BR>This register is RES0 if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 1.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0001014.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The DWT_LSUCNT bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>LSUCNT, bits [7:0]<BR>Load-store overhead counter.<BR>Counts one on each cycle when all of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; DWT_CTRL.LSUEVTENA == 1 and DEMCR.TRCENA == 1.<BR>&#8226; No instruction is executed, see DWT_CPICNT.<BR>&#8226; No exception-entry or exception-exit operation is in progress, see DWT_EXCCNT.<BR>&#8226; A load-store operation is in progress.<BR>&#8226; Either SecureNoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE, or NS-Req for the operation is set to<BR>Non-secure and NoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE.<BR>Initialized to zero when the counter is disabled and DWT_CTRL.LSUEVTENA is written with 1.<BR>An Event Counter packet is emitted on counter overflow.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Cold reset.
