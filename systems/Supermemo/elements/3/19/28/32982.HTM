D1.2.57 DWT_CYCCNT, DWT Cycle Count Register</P>
<P>The DWT_CYCCNT characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Shows or sets the value of the processor cycle counter, CYCCNT.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if DWT_CTRL.NOCYCCNT == 0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if DWT_CTRL.NOCYCCNT == 1.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0001004.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DWT_CYCCNT bit assignments are:</P>
<P>CYCCNT, bits [31:0]<BR>Incrementing cycle counter value. Increments one on each processor clock cycle when DWT_CTRL.CYCCNTENA == 1 and DEMCR.TRCENA == 1. On overflow, CYCCNT wraps to<BR>zero. This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Cold reset.
