D1.2.56 DWT_CTRL, DWT Control Register 
<P></P>
<P>The DWT_CTRL characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides configuration and status information for the DWT unit, and used to control features of the unit.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0001000.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
