D1.2.59 DWT_DEVTYPE, DWT Device Type Register</P>
<P>The DWT_DEVTYPE characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the DWT.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0001FCC.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DWT_DEVTYPE bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>SUB, bits [7:4]<BR>Subtype. Component subtype.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x0 Other.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.</P>
<P>MAJOR, bits [3:0]<BR>Major type. Component major type.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x0 Miscellaneous.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.
