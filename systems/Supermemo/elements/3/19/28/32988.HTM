D1.2.63 DWT_LAR, DWT Software Lock Access Register</P>
<P>The DWT_LAR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provides CoreSight Software Lock control for the DWT, see the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482;<BR>Architecture Specification for details.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>This register is RAZ/WI if accessed via the debugger.<BR>Configurations Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the optional Software Lock is implemented.<BR>This register is RAZ/WI if the Software Lock is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit write-only register located at 0xE0001FB0.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The DWT_LAR bit assignments are:<BR>KEY, bits [31:0]<BR>Lock Access control.<BR>Writing the key value 0xC5ACCE55 to this field unlocks the lock, enabling write accesses to this<BR>component's registers through a memory-mapped interface.<BR>Writing any other value to this register locks the lock, disabling write accesses to this component's<BR>registers through a memory mapped interface.
