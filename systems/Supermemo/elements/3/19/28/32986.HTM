D1.2.61 <FONT class=extract>DWT_FOLDCNT, DWT Folded Instruction Count Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The DWT_FOLDCNT characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>Increments on the additional cycles required to execute all load or store instructions</FONT>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 0.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 1.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0001018.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DWT_FOLDCNT bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>FOLDCNT, bits [7:0]<BR>Folded instruction counter.<BR>Counts on each cycle when all of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; DWT_CTRL.FOLDEVTENA == 1 and DEMCR.TRCENA == 1.<BR>&#8226; At least two instructions are executed, see DWT_CPICNT.<BR>&#8226; Either SecureNoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE, or the PE is in Non-secure state and NoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE.<BR>The counter is incremented by the number of instructions executed, minus one.<BR>Initialized to zero when the counter is disabled and DWT_CTRL.FOLDEVTENA is written with 1. An event is emitted on counter overflow.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Cold reset.
