D1.2.33 <FONT class=extract>DCRSR, Debug Core Register Select Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The DCRSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>With the DCRDR, provides debug access to the general-purpose registers, special-purpose registers, and the FP extension registers. A write to the DCRSR specifies the register to transfer, whether the transfer is a read or write, and starts the transfer</FONT>.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; Writes to this register while the PE is in Non-debug state are ignored.<BR>&nbsp; This register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 to software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if Halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit write-only register located at 0xE000EDF4.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DCRSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [31:17]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>REGWnR, bit [16]<BR>Register write/not-read. Specifies the access type for the transfer.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Read.<BR>1 Write.</P>
<P>Bits [15:7]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>REGSEL, bits [6:0]<BR>Register selector. Specifies the general-purpose register, special-purpose register, or FP register to transfer.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000000-0b0001100 General-purpose registers R0-R12.<BR>0b0001101 Current stack pointer, SP.<BR>0b0001110 LR.<BR>0b0001111 DebugReturnAddress.<BR>0b0010000 XPSR.<BR>0b0010001 Current state main stack pointer, SP_main.<BR>0b0010010 Current state process stack pointer, SP_process.<BR>0b0010100 Current state {CONTROL[7:0],FAULTMASK[7:0],BASEPRI[7:0],PRIMASK[7:0]}.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, bits [23:8] of the transfer value are RES0.<BR>0b0011000 Non-secure main stack pointer, MSP_NS.<BR>&nbsp; If the Security Extension is not implemented, this value is reserved.<BR>0b0011001 Non-secure process stack pointer, PSP_NS.<BR>&nbsp; If the Security Extension is not implemented, this value is reserved.<BR>0b0011010 Secure main stack pointer, MSP_S.

Accessible only when DHCSR.SSDE == 1.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, bits [23:8] of the transfer value are RES0. If the Security Extension is not implemented, this value is reserved.<BR>0b0100011 {CONTROL[7:0],FAULTMASK[7:0],BASEPRI[7:0],PRIMASK[7:0]}_NS.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, bits [23:8] of the transfer value are RES0. If the Security Extension is not implemented, this value is reserved.<BR>0b1000000-0b1011111 FP registers, S0-S31.<BR>&nbsp; If the Floating-point Extension is not implemented, these values are reserved.</P>
<P>All other values are reserved.</P>
<P>If the Floating-point and Security Extensions are implemented, then the FPSCR and S0-S31 are not accessible from Non-secure state if DHCSR.S_SDE == 0 and either:<BR>&#8226; FPCCR indicates the registers contain values from Secure state.<BR>&#8226; NSACR prevents Non-secure access to the registers.<BR>Registers that are not accessible are RAZ/WI.<BR>If this field is written with a reserved value, the PE might behave as if a defined value was written, or ignore the value written, and the value of DCRDR becomes UNKNOWN.
