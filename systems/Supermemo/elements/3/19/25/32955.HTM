D1.2.34 DDEVARCH, SCS Device Architecture Register
<P></P>
<P>The DDEVARCH characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides CoreSight discovery information for the SCS.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>&nbsp; Present only if Halting debug is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if Halting debug is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000EFBC.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DDEVARCH_NS located at 0xE002EFBC. The location 0xE002EFBC is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The DDEVARCH bit assignments are:</P>
<P>ARCHITECT, bits [31:21]<BR>Architect. Defines the architect of the component. Bits [31:28] are the JEP106 continuation code (JEP106 bank ID, minus 1) and bits [27:21] are the JEP106 ID code.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0x23B JEP106 continuation code 0x4, ID code 0x3B. ARM Limited.<BR>Other values are defined by the JEDEC JEP106 standard.<BR>This field reads as 0x23B.</P>
<P>PRESENT, bit [20]<BR>DEVARCH Present. Defines that the DEVARCH register is present.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>1 DEVARCH information present.<BR>This bit reads as one.</P>
<P>REVISION, bits [19:16]<BR>Revision. Defines the architecture revision of the component.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0000 M-profile debug architecture v3.0.<BR>This field reads as 0b0000.</P>
<P>ARCHVER, bits [15:12]<BR>Architecture Version. Defines the architecture version of the component.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0b0010 M-profile debug architecture v3.<BR>ARCHVER and ARCHPART are also defined as a single field, ARCHID, such that ARCHVER is ARCHID[15:12].<BR>This field reads as 0b0010.</P>
<P>ARCHPART, bits [11:0]<BR>Architecture Part. Defines the architecture of the component.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0xA04 M-profile debug architecture.<BR>ARCHVER and ARCHPART are also defined as a single field, ARCHID, such that ARCHPART is ARCHID[11:0].<BR>This field reads as 0xA04.
