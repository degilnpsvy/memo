is cast to a pointer to the given type. If <EM class=parameter><CODE>n_structs</CODE></EM> is 0 it returns <A title=NULL class=link href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Standard-Macros.html#NULL:CAPS"><CODE class=literal>NULL</CODE></A>. Care is taken to avoid overflow when calculating the size of the allocated block.</P>
<P>Since the returned pointer is already casted to the right type, it is normally unnecessary to cast it explicitly, and doing so might hide memory allocation errors.
