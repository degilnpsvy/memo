D1.2.67 DWT_PIDR0, DWT Peripheral Identification Register 0</P>
<P>The DWT_PIDR0 characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Provides CoreSight discovery information for the DWT.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if CoreSight identification is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if CoreSight identification is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE0001FE0.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The DWT_PIDR0 bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>PART_0, bits [7:0]<BR>Part number bits [7:0]. See the ARM&#174; CoreSight&#8482; Architecture Specification.<BR>This field reads as an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value.
