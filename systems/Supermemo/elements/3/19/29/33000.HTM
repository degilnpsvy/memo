D1.2.75 DWT_SLEEPCNT, DWT Sleep Count Register<BR>The DWT_SLEEPCNT characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Counts the total number of cycles that the processor is sleeping.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Present only if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 0.<BR>This register is RES0 if DWT_CTRL.NOPRFCNT == 1.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE0001010.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The DWT_SLEEPCNT bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:8]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>SLEEPCNT, bits [7:0]<BR>Sleep counter.<BR>Counts one on each cycle when all of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; DWT_CTRL.SLEEPEVTENA == 1 and DEMCR.TRCENA == 1.<BR>&#8226; No instruction is executed, see DWT_CPICNT.<BR>&#8226; No load-store operation is in progress, see DWT_LSUCNT.<BR>&#8226; No exception-entry or exception-exit operation is in progress, see DWT_EXCCNT.<BR>&#8226; The PE is in a power-saving mode.<BR>&#8226; Either SecureNoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE, or the PE is in Non-secure state and<BR>NoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == TRUE.<BR>Power-saving modes include WFI, WFE, and Sleep-on-exit.<BR>All power-saving features are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED and therefore when this counter counts is<BR>IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. In particular, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the counter<BR>increments if the PE is in a power-saving mode and SCR.SLEEPDEEP is set.<BR>Initialized to zero when the counter is disabled and DWT_CTRL.SLEEPEVTENA is written with<BR>1. An Event Counter packet is emitted on counter overflow.<BR>This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Cold reset.<BR>Note<BR>ARM recommends that this counter counts all cycles when the PE is sleeping and<BR>SCR.SLEEPDEEP is clear, regardless of whether a WFI or WFE instruction, or Sleep-on-exit,<BR>caused the entry to the power-saving mode.
