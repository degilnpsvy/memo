D1.2.66 DWT_PCSR, DWT Program Counter Sample Register
<P></P>
<P>The DWT_PCSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose Samples the current value of the program counter.<BR>Usage constraints Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this<BR>register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software. Otherwise the register is<BR>accessible to the debugger and software.<BR>Configurations Present only if the DWT is implemented.<BR>This register is RES0 if the DWT is not implemented.<BR>Attributes 32-bit read-only register located at 0xE000101C.<BR>This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>Field descriptions<BR>The DWT_PCSR bit assignments are:<BR>EIASAMPLE, bits [31:0]<BR>Executed instruction address sample. Recently executed instruction address sample value.<BR>The possible values of this field are:<BR>0xFFFFFFFF<BR>One of the following is true:<BR>&#8226; The PE is halted in Debug state.<BR>&#8226; The Security Extension is implemented, the sampled instruction was executed in Secure state, and SecureNoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == FALSE.<BR>&#8226; NoninvasiveDebugAllowed() == FALSE.<BR>&#8226; DEMCR.TRCENA == 0.<BR>&#8226; The address of a recently executed instruction is not available.<BR>Not 0xFFFFFFFF<BR>Instruction address of a recently executed instruction. Bit [0] of the sample instruction<BR>address is 0.<BR>The conditions when the address of a recently executed instruction is not available are<BR>IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.
