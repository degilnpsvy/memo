The following mechanism is called <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>:<BR>&#8226; The PE takes a <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> during an exception entry if the <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> is higher priority, including taking into account any priority adjustment by AIRCR.PRIS. In this case:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> uses the exception entry sequence started by the original exception. The original exception remains pending.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The PE takes the original exception after returning from the <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN>.
