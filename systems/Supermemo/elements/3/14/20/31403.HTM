<P>PENDSTSET, bit [26], on a read<BR>Pend SysTick set. Indicates whether the SysTick for the selected Security state exception is pending.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 SysTick exception not pending.<BR>1 SysTick exception pending.<BR>If both PENDSTSET and PENDSTCLR are written to one simultaneously, the pending state of the associated SysTick exception becomes UNKNOWN.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>PENDSTCLR, bit [25]<BR>Pend SysTick clear. Allows the SysTick exception pend state to be cleared for the selected Security state.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No effect.<BR>1 Clear pending status.<BR>This bit is write-only, and reads-as-zero.<BR>This bit is write-one-to-clear. Writes of zero are ignored.
