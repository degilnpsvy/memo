Errors on preemption and stacking for exception entry<BR>RVKTX <FONT class=extract>An SAU violation, MPU violation, NOCP UsageFault, STKOF UsageFault, LSERR SecureFault, or synchronous bus error during context stacking causes lockup when:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The exception would escalate to a Secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; NMI is active and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The exception would escalate to a Non-secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Non-secure HardFault or Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; NMI is active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; FAULTMASK_NS.FM or FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these cases the point of PE lockup is when, after the exception to be taken has been chosen, the handler for that exception is entered. These cases do not in themselves cause any additional exception to become pending.</FONT><BR>RQSSB <FONT class=extract>When an SAU violation, MPU violation, NOCP UsageFault, STKOF UsageFault, LSERR SecureFault, or synchronous bus error occurs during context stacking, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the PE continues to stack any of the remaining context.</FONT><BR>RGJJG <FONT class=extract>At the point of encountering an SAU violation, MPU violation, NOCP UsageFault, STKOF UsageFault, LSERR SecureFault, or synchronous bus error during context stacking, the PE:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Updates any Fault Status Registers associated with the error.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Does not set HFSR.FORCED to 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the point of lockup:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; All state, including the LR, IPSR, and active and pending bits, is modified as though the fault on context stacking had never occurred, other than the following:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; EPSR.T becomes UNKNOWN.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; EPSR.IT is set to zero.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; The PC is set to 0xEFFFFFFE.</FONT>
