Context unstacking is performed after any clearing of exception active bits or FAULTMASK, that is required by the exception return, has been made visible. An SAU violation, MPU violation, or synchronous bus error during context unstacking causes lockup when:<BR>&#8226; The exception would escalate to a Secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&#8213; Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&#8213; FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>&#8213; Non-secure Hardfault is active and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is 0.<BR>&#8226; The exception would escalate to a Non-secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&#8213; Non-secure HardFault or Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&#8213; NMI is active.<BR>&#8213; FAULTMASK_NS.FM or FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.
