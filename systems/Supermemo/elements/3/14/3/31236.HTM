When current execution has a priority number &#8805;0:<BR>&#8226; <FONT class=clozed>If a synchronous exception with an equal or lower priority is pending, the PE hardware escalates it to become a HardFault. This rule applies to all synchronous exceptions and DebugMonitor exceptions caused by the BKPT instruction. This rule does not apply to asynchronous exceptions and all other DebugMonitor exceptions.</FONT>
