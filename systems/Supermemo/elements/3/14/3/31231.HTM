D2.2.217 <FONT class=extract>VTOR, Vector Table Offset Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The VTOR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds the vector table address for the selected Security state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED08.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via VTOR_NS located at 0xE002ED08. The location 0xE002ED08 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P>Field descriptions<BR>The VTOR bit assignments are:<BR><FONT class=extract>TBLOFF, bits [31:7]<BR>Table offset. Bits [31:7] of the vector table address for the selected Security state.<BR>It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether any of the TBLOFF bits are WI.<BR>This field resets to an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value on a Warm reset.</FONT><BR>Bits [6:0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
