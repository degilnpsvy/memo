In a PE with the Security Extension, two vector tables are implemented, the Secure Vector table and the Non-secure<BR>Vector table, and it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED which of the following is true:<BR>&#8226; The PE supports configurability of each vector table base, and two Vector Table Offset Registers, VTOR_S<BR>and VTOR_NS, are provided for this purpose.<BR>&#8226; The PE does not support configurability of either vector table base, and VTOR_S and VTOR_NS are<BR>RAZ/WI.<BR>If the PE supports configurability of each vector table base:<BR>&#8226; Exceptions that target Secure state use VTOR_S to determine the base address of the Secure vector table.<BR>&#8226; Exceptions that target Non-secure state use VTOR_NS to determine the base address of the Non-secure vector table.
