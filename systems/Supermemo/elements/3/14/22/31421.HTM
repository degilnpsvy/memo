The NVIC_ITNS&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:<BR>ITNS, bits [31:0]<BR>Interrupt Targets Non-secure. For ITNS[m] in NVIC_ITNSn, this field indicates and allows modification of the target Security state for interrupt 32n+m.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt targets Secure state.<BR>1 Interrupt targets Non-secure state.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether individual bits are WI and have an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED constant value. Where an interrupt is configured to target Secure state, accesses to the associated fields in Non-secure versions of the NVIC_IABR, NVIC_ICER, NVIC_ISER, NVIC_ICPR, NVIC_IPR and NVIC_ISPR are RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
