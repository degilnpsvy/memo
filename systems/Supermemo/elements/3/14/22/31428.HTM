The UFSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Contains the status for some instruction execution faults, and for data access faults.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 16-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000ED2A.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via UFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED2A. The location 0xE002ED2A is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>&nbsp; This register is part of CFSR.
