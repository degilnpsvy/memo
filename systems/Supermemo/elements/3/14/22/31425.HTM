The PE can abandon execution of a Load Multiple or Store Multiple instruction to take an exception, and after returning from the exception, restart the Load Multiple or Store Multiple instruction again from the start of the instruction. This is called <FONT class=clozed>instruction restart</FONT>. Instruction restart is supported regardless of whether the Main Extension is implemented.
