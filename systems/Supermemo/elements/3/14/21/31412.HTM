ACTIVE, bits [31:0]<BR>Active state. For ACTIVE[m] in NVIC_IABRn, indicates the active state for interrupt 32n+m.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt not active.<BR>1 Interrupt is active.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. Bits corresponding to interrupts targeting Secure state are RAZ/WI from Non-secure.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
