During exception entry exceptions can occur, for example asynchronous exceptions, or the exception entry sequence itself might cause an exception, for example a MemManage fault on the push to the stack.<BR>Any exception that occurs during exception entry is a late-arriving exception, and:<BR>&#8226; The exception that caused the original entry sequence is the original exception.<BR>&#8226; The priority of the code stream running at the time of the original exception is the preempted priority.<BR>When the exception entry sequence itself causes an exception, the latter exception is a derived exception.<BR>The following mechanism is called late-arrival preemption:<BR>&#8226; The PE takes a late-arriving exception during an exception entry if the late-arriving exception is higher priority, including taking into account any priority adjustment by AIRCR.PRIS. In this case:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The late-arriving exception uses the exception entry sequence started by the original exception. The original exception remains pending.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The PE takes the original exception after returning from the late-arriving exception.
