If the PE recognizes a new asynchronous exception while it is tail-chaining, and the new asynchronous exception has a higher priority than the next tailed-chained exception, the PE can, instead, take the new asynchronous exception, using late-arrival preemption.<BR>This rule is true even if the next tail-chained exception is a derived exception on exception return. The PE can, instead, take the new asynchronous exception. If it does, the derived exception becomes pending.
