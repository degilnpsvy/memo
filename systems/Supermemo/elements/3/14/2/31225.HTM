When the PE is using instruction resume, EPSR.ICI is set to a non-zero value that is the continuation state of the exception-continuable instruction:<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; For LDM, LDMDB, STM, STMDB, POP, and PUSH instructions, ICI contains the number of the first register in the register list that must be loaded or stored after instruction resume.<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; For the floating-point instructions VLDM, VSTM, VPOP, and VPUSH, ICI contains the number of the lowest numbered doubleword Floating-point Extension register that was not completely loaded or stored before the PE took the exception.<BR>The ICI values shown in the following table are valid EPSR.ICI values:<BR>EPSR[26:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EPSR[15:12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EPSR[11:10]<BR>ICI[7:6] = 0b00&nbsp; ICI[5:2] = reg_num&nbsp; ICI[1:0] = 0b00<BR>ICI[7:6] = 0b00&nbsp; ICI[5:2] = 0b0000&nbsp;&nbsp; ICI[1:0] - 0b00
