UNALIGN_TRP, bit [3]<BR>Unaligned trap. Controls the trapping of unaligned word or halfword accesses.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Unaligned accesses permitted from <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.<BR>1 Any unaligned transaction generates an UNALIGNED UsageFault.<BR>Unaligned load/store multiples and atomic/exclusive accesses always generate an UNALIGNED UsageFault.<BR>If the Main Extension is not implemented, this bit is RES1.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset if the Main Extension is implemented.
