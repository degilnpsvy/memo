The following mechanism is called late-arrival preemption:<BR>&#8226; The PE takes a late-arriving exception during an exception entry if the late-arriving exception is higher priority, including taking into account any priority adjustment by AIRCR.PRIS. In this case:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The late-arriving exception uses the exception entry sequence started by the original exception. The original exception remains pending.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; The PE takes the original exception after returning from the late-arriving exception.
