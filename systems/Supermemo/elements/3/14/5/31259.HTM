On reset, if reading the vector table to obtain either the vector for the reset handler or the initialization value for the main stack pointer causes a bus error, the PE enters lockup in HardFault with the following behavior:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; HFSR.VECTTBL is set to 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; In a PE with the Security Extension, Secure Hardfault is made active. That is, SHCSR_S.HARDFAULTACT is set to 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; In a PE without the Security Extension, HardFault is made active. That is, SHCSR.HARDFAULTACT is set to 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; An UNKNOWN value is loaded into the main stack pointer.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The IPSR is set to 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; EPSR.T is UNKNOWN.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; EPSR.IT is set to zero.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The PC is set to 0xEFFFFFFE.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The LR is set to 0xFFFFFFFF.
