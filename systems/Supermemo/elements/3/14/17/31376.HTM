The SHCSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: <FONT class=clozed>Provides access to the active and pending status of system exceptions.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED24.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SHCSR_NS located at 0xE002ED24. The location 0xE002ED24 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states on a bit by bit basis.<BR>Preface: </FONT><FONT class=extract>Exception processing automatically updates the SHCSR fields. However, software can write to the register to add or remove the pending or active state of an exception. When updating the SHCSR, ARM recommends using a read-modify-write sequence, to avoid unintended effects on the state of the exception handlers.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing the active state of an exception can change the current execution priority, and affect the exception return consistency checks. If software removes the active state, causing a change in current execution priority, this can defeat the architectural behavior that prevents an exception from preempting its own handler.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pending state bits are set to one when an exception occurs and are cleared to zero when the exception becomes active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active state bits are set to one when the associated exception becomes active.</FONT>
