After exit from lockup by <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, a subsequent return from <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> without modifying the return address attempts to execute from 0xEFFFFFFE. Execution from this address is guaranteed to generate an IACCVIOL MemManage fault, causing the PE to reenter lockup if the execution priority has not been modified. Modification of the return address would enable execution to be resumed, however ARM recommends treating entry to lockup as fatal and requiring the PE to be reset.
