SYSTICKACT, bit [11]<BR>SysTick exception active state. This bit indicates and allows modification of the active state of the SysTick exception for the selected Security state.<BR>If two SysTick timers are implemented this bit is banked between Security states.<BR>If less than two SysTick timers are implemented this bit is not banked between Security states, and is RAZ/WI if AIRCR.STTNS is zero.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 SysTick exception not active for the selected Security state.<BR>1 SysTick exception active for the selected Security state.<BR>If two timers are implemented, then SYSTICKACT is banked between Security states. If one timer is implemented this bit corresponds to the Secure state if AIRCR.STTNS is zero, or the Non-secure state3 if AIRCR.STTNS is one.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
