Errors when unstacking state on exception return<BR>RWKSJ <FONT class=extract>Context unstacking is performed after any clearing of exception active bits or FAULTMASK, that is required by the exception return, has been made visible. An SAU violation, MPU violation, or synchronous bus error during context unstacking causes lockup when:<BR>&#8226; The exception would escalate to a Secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&#8213; Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&#8213; FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>&#8213; Non-secure Hardfault is active and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is 0.<BR>&#8226; The exception would escalate to a Non-secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&#8213; Non-secure HardFault or Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&#8213; NMI is active.<BR>&#8213; FAULTMASK_NS.FM or FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.</FONT><BR>RXFCQ <FONT class=extract>When an SAU violation, MPU violation, or synchronous bus error during context unstacking causes lockup, the PE:<BR>&#8226; Updates any Fault Status Registers associated with the error.<BR>&#8226; Sets IPSR to 0, if EXC_RETURN for the returning exception indicated a return to Thread mode.<BR>&#8226; Sets IPSR to 3, if EXC_RETURN for the returning exception indicated a return to Handler mode.<BR>&#8226; Sets the stack pointer used for unstacking to the value it would have had if the fault had not occurred.<BR>&#8213; If the XPSR load faults, the SP is 64-bit aligned.<BR>&#8226; Updates CONTROL.FPCA, based on EXC_RETURN.FType.<BR>&#8226; Sets the PC to 0xEFFFFFFE.<BR>In addition, the APSR, EPSR, FPSCR, R0-R12, LR, and S0-S31 are UNKNOWN.</FONT>
