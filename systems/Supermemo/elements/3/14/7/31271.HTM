Vector read error on NMI or HardFault entry<BR>RCTKP <FONT class=extract>On entry to an NMI or HardFault, if reading the vector table to obtain the vector for the NMI or HardFault handler causes a bus error, the PE enters lockup with the following behavior:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; HFSR.VECTTBL is set to 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The IPSR is updated to hold the exception number of the exception taken.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The active bit of the exception taken is set to 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The pending bit of the exception taken is cleared to 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; EPSR.T is UNKNOWN.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; EPSR.IT is set to zero.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The LR is set to the EXC_RETURN value that would have been used had the fault not occurred.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The PC is set to 0xEFFFFFFE.</FONT><BR>INMRW <FONT class=extract>Because SAU violations on vector reads are required to be treated as late-arriving, they cannot cause lockup, instead resulting in a higher priority exception being taken. Vector reads always use the default memory map and cannot generate MPU violations.</FONT>
