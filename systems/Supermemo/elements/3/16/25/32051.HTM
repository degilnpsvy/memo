In a PE with the Security Extension but without the Floating-point Extension, after the PE hardware has pushed state context to the stack, it sets R0-R3, R12, APSR, and EPSR to:<BR><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR>If the PE did not also push additional state context to the stack, as indicated by EXC_RETURN.DCRS, the values of R4-R11 remain unchanged.<BR>If the PE also pushed additional state context to the stack, as indicated by EXC_RETURN.DCRS, then afterwards:<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; If the Background Security state is Non-secure, R4-R11 remain unchanged.<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; If the Background Security state is Secure, the PE sets R4-R11 to:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; An UNKNOWN value if the exception is taken to Secure state.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Zero if the exception is taken to Non-secure state.
