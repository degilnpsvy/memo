In a PE without the Main Extension and without the Security Extension MSPLIM_S and PSPLIM_S are invisible.<BR>These registers hold stack limit values.<BR>A stack can descend to its stack limit value. Any attempt to descend the stack further than its stack limit value is a violation of the stack limit.<BR>xSPLIM_x[2:0] are treated as RES0, so that all stack pointer limits are always guaranteed to be doubleword-aligned. Bits [31:3] of the xSPLIM_x registers are writeable.</P>

<P>RTFCK A PE that does not implement the Main Extension, and does not implement the Security Extension does not implement stack-limit checking.
