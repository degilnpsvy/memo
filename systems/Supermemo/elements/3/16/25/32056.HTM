In a PE with the Security Extension and Floating-point Extension, register clearing behavior after context stacking is as follows:<BR>State context and additional state context<BR>&nbsp; Register clearing behavior is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.<BR>FP context and additional FP context<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; If FPCCR_S.TS is 0 when the FP context is pushed to the stack, S0-S15 and the FPSCR are set to an UNKNOWN value after stacking.<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; If FPCCR_S.TS is 1 when the FP context and additional FP context are both pushed to the stack, S0-S31 and the FPSCR are set to zero after stacking.<BR>&nbsp; In both cases, CONTROL.FPCA is set to 0 to indicate that the Floating-point Extension is not active.
