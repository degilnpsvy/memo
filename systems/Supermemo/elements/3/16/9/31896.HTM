SLEEPDEEPS, bit [3]<BR>Sleep deep secure. This field controls whether the SLEEPDEEP bit is only accessible from the Secure state.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The SLEEPDEEP bit accessible from both Security states.<BR>1 The SLEEPDEEP bit behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the Non-secure state.<BR>This bit in only accessible from the Secure state, and behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the Non-secure state. If a PE does not implement the deep sleep state this bit behaves as RAZ/WI from both Security states.<BR>This bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
