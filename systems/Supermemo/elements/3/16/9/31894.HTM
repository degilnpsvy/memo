D1.2.178&nbsp;<FONT class=extract>SCR, System Control Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The SCR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Sets or returns system control data.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000ED10.<BR>Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via SCR_NS located at 0xE002ED10. The location 0xE002ED10 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>This register is banked between Security states on a bit by bit basis.</P>
<P>Bits [31:5]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SEVONPEND, bit [4]<BR>Send event on pend. Determines whether an interrupt assigned to the same Security state as the SEVONPEND bit transitioning from inactive state to pending state generates a wakeup event.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Transitions from inactive to pending are not wakeup events.<BR>1 Transitions from inactive to pending are wakeup events.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SLEEPDEEPS, bit [3]<BR>Sleep deep secure. This field controls whether the SLEEPDEEP bit is only accessible from the Secure state.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 The SLEEPDEEP bit accessible from both Security states.<BR>1 The SLEEPDEEP bit behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the Non-secure state.<BR>This bit in only accessible from the Secure state, and behaves as RAZ/WI when accessed from the Non-secure state. If a PE does not implement the deep sleep state this bit behaves as RAZ/WI from both Security states.<BR>This bit is RAZ/WI from Non-secure state.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SLEEPDEEP, bit [2]<BR>Sleep deep. Provides a qualifying hint indicating that waking from sleep might take longer. An implementation can use this bit to select between two alternative sleep states.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Selected sleep state is not deep sleep.<BR>1 Selected sleep state is deep sleep.<BR>Details of the implemented sleep states, if any, and details of the use of this bit, are IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED. If the PE does not implement a deep sleep state then this bit can be RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>SLEEPONEXIT, bit [1]<BR>Sleep on exit. Determines whether, on an exit from an ISR that returns to the base level of execution priority, the PE enters a sleep state.<BR>This bit is banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Enter sleep state disabled.<BR>1 Enter sleep state permitted.<BR>The Secure version of this field is used if the Background state being returned to is the Secure state, otherwise the Non-secure version is used.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P>Bit [0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
