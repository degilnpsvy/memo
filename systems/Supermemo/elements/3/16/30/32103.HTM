Updates to the stack pointer by the MSR instruction targeting SP_NS are subject to stack limit checking. Updates to the stack pointer and stack pointer limit by any other MSR instruction are not subject to stack limit checking.<BR>For all other instructions that can update the stack pointer and stack pointer limit, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether stack limit checking is performed.
