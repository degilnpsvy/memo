In a PE with the Main Extension, if the PE takes an exception during any Load Multiple or Store Multiple instruction, including PUSH and POP:<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; If the instruction is not in an IT block and the exception is an asynchronous exception, the PE <FONT class=clozed>uses instruction resume and EPSR.ICI holds the continuation state</FONT>. The base register is restored to the original value except in the following cases:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interrupt of an instruction that is using SP as the base register<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT class=clozed>The SP that is presented to the exception entry sequence is lower than any element pushed by an STM, or not yet popped by an LDM. For Decrement Before (DB) variants of the instruction, the SP is set to the final value. This is the lowest value in the list.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Increment After (IA) variants of the instruction, the SP is restored to the initial value. This is the lowest value in the list.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interrupt of an instruction that is not using SP as the base register<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT class=clozed>The base register is set to the final value, whether the instruction is a Decrement Before (DB) variant or an Increment After (IA) variant.</FONT><BR>&nbsp; &#8226; For all other cases:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; The PE uses <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
