B5.30 Behavior of Preload Data (PLD) and Preload Instruction (PLI) instructions with caches</P>
<P>ICQLR The instructions are memory system hints and their effect is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.</P>
<P>ITPPK The instructions do not generate exceptions but the memory system operations might generate an imprecise fault (asynchronous exception) because of the memory access.</P>
<P>RQNGJ A PLD instruction does not cause any effect to the caches or memory other than the effects that, for permission or other reasons, can be caused by the equivalent load from the same location with the same context and at the same privilege level and Security state.</P>
<P>RSFNK A PLD instruction does not access Device-nGnRnE or Device-nGnRE memory.</P>
<P>RHNLN A PLI instruction does not cause any effect to the caches or memory other than the effects that, for permission or other reasons, can be caused by the fetch resulting from changing the PC to the location specified by the PLI instruction with the same context and at the same privilege level and Security state.</P>
<P>RMRFG A PLI instruction cannot access memory that has the Device-nGnRnE or Device-nGnRE attribute.</P>
