B5.29 Cache behavior at reset</P>
<P>RKCFK All caches are disabled at reset.</P>
<P>RJMBT An implementation can require the use of a specific cache initialization routine to invalidate its storage array before it is enabled:<BR>&#8226; The exact form of any required cache initialization routine is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.<BR>&#8226; If a required initialization routine is not performed, the state of an enabled cache is UNPREDICTABLE.</P>
<P>RTVKQ If an implementation permits cache hits when the cache is disabled, the cache initialization routine provides a mechanism to ensure the correct initialization of the caches.</P>
<P>RCJGV If an implementation permits cache hits when the cache is disabled and the cache contents are not invalidated at reset, the initialization routine avoids any possibility of running from an uninitialized cache.</P>
<P>IJSQQ An initialization routine can require a fixed instruction sequence to be placed in a restricted range of memory.</P>
<P>IJCTD ARM recommends that whenever an invalidation routine is required, it is based on the ARMv8-M cache maintenance operations.</P>
