B5.33 Ordering of cache maintenance operations</P>
<P>RGCNB All cache and branch predictor maintenance operations that do not specify an address execute, relative to each other, in program order.</P>
<P>RGXNL All cache maintenance operations that specify an address:<BR>&#8226; Execute in program order relative to all cache operations that do not specify an address.<BR>&#8226; Execute in program order relative to all cache maintenance operations that specify the same address.<BR>&#8226; Can execute in any order relative to cache maintenance operations that specify a different address.</P>
<P>RRTJG There is no restriction on the ordering of data or unified cache maintenance operation by address relative to any explicit load or store.</P>
<P>RMJPP There is no restriction on the ordering of a data or unified cache maintenance operation by set/way relative to any explicit load or store.</P>
<P>IVXXZ A DSB instruction can be inserted to enforce ordering as required.</P>
<P>RSWBG For the ICIALLU operation, the value in the register specified by the STR instruction that performs the operation is ignored.</P>
<P>IZQQZ In a PE with the Security Extension, if cache maintenance operations are required when the security attribution of memory is changed, the following sequence of steps can be followed:<BR>1. If the attribution of the address range is changing from Secure to Non-secure, ensure that memory does not contain any data that must remain secure.<BR>2. Execute a DSB instruction.<BR>3. Clean the affected lines in data or unified caches using the DCC* instruction.<BR>4. Execute a DSB instruction.<BR>5. Change the security attribution of the address range.<BR>6. Execute a DSB instruction.<BR>7. Invalidate the affected lines in all caches using the DCI* and ICI* instructions.<BR>8. Execute a Context synchronization event.</P>
