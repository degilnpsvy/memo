B5.27 Cache coherency</P>
<P>RNNDJ Data coherency of caches is ensured:<BR>&#8226; When caches are not used.<BR>&#8226; As a result of cache maintenance operations.<BR>&#8226; By the use of hardware coherency mechanisms to ensure coherency of data accesses to memory for cacheable locations by observers in different Shareability domains.</P>
<P>RCPGW Hardware is not required to ensure coherency between instruction caches and memory, even for regions of memory with the Shareability attribute.</P>
<P>IQXXC An ISB and a DSB can ensure coherency where this is required.</P>
