<P>RHVXX Branch predictor maintenance operations are independent of cache maintenance operations.</P>
<P>RNSRK A Context synchronization event that follows a branch predictor maintenance operation guarantees that the effects of the branch predictor maintenance operation are visible to all instructions after the context synchronization event.</P>
<P>RHRXF For the BPIALL operation, the value in the register specified by the STR instruction that performs the operation is ignored.</P>
<P>RLXHX As a side-effect of a branch predictor maintenance operation, any entry in the branch predictor might be invalidated.</P>
