B5.28 Cache enabling and disabling</P>
<P>IPPLL The Configuration and Control Register, CCR, enables and disables caches across all levels of cache that are visible to the PE.</P>
<P>RHTLD It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the CCR.DC and CCR.IC bits affect the memory attributes that are generated by an enabled MPU.</P>
<P>ITNHX An implementation can use control bits in the Auxiliary Control Register, ACTLR, for finer-grained control of cache enabling.</P>
<P>RDSTQ If the MPU is disabled, MPU_CTRL.ENABLE == 0, the CCR.DC and CCR.IC bits determine the cache state for cacheable regions of the default address map.</P>
