Forward progress can only be made using LoadExcl/StoreExcl loops if, for any LoadExcl/StoreExcl loop within a single thread of execution if both of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; There are no explicit memory accesses, pre-loads, direct or indirect register writes, cache maintenance instructions, SVC instructions, or exception returns between the Load-Exclusive and the Store-Exclusive.<BR>&#8226; The following conditions apply between the Store-Exclusive having returned a fail result and the retry of the Load-Exclusive:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; There are no stores to any location within the same Exclusives reservation granule that the Store-Exclusive is accessing.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; There are no direct or indirect register writes, other than changes to the flag fields in APSR or FPSCR, caused by data processing or comparison instructions.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; There are no direct or indirect cache maintenance instructions, SVC instructions, or exception returns.<BR>&nbsp; The exclusive monitor can be cleared at any time without an application-related cause, provided that such clearing is not systematically repeated so as to prevent the forward progress in finite time of at least one of the threads that is accessing the exclusive monitor.
