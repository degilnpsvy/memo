Fault mask enable. The Secure and Non-secure FAULTMASK registers individually boost the current execution priority based on the settings of AIRCR.PRIS and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS. 
<P></P>
<P>If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero, AIRCR.PRIS is zero, and FAULTMASK_NS.FM is one, the execution priority is boosted to 0. </P>
<P>If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero, AIRCR.PRIS is one, and FAULTMASK_NS.FM is one, the execution priority is boosted to 0x80. </P>
<P>If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is zero and FAULTMASK_S is one, the execution priority is boosted to <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. </P>
<P>If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is one and FAULTMASK_NS is one, the execution priority is boosted to -1. </P>
<P>If AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is one and FAULTMASK_S is one, the execution priority is boosted to -3.</P>
<P>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No effect.<BR>1 Boost priority.</P>
<P>On an exception return from a raw execution priority greater or equal to zero, the FM bit corresponding to EXC_RETURN.ES is cleared.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
