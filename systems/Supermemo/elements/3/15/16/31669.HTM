B5.24 Caches</P>
<P>IJSPB When a memory location is marked with a Normal Cacheable memory attribute, determining whether a copy of the memory location is held in a cache can depend on many aspects of the implementation, such as the following factors:<BR>&#8226; The size, line length, and associativity of the cache.<BR>&#8226; The cache allocation algorithm.<BR>&#8226; Activity by other elements of the system that can access the memory.<BR>&#8226; Speculative instruction fetching algorithms.<BR>&#8226; Speculative data fetching algorithms.<BR>&#8226; Interrupt behaviors.</P>
<P>RQGSQ An implementation can include multiple levels of cache, up to a maximum of seven levels, in a hierarchical memory system.</P>
<P>ISTRV The lower the cache level, the closer the cache is to the PE.</P>
<P>RPCSR Entries for addresses with a Normal cacheable attribute can be allocated to an enabled cache at any time.</P>
<P>RJGBL The allocation of a memory address to a cache location is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.</P>
<P>RSBGJ A cache entry covers at least 16 bytes and no more than 2KB of contiguous address space, aligned to its size.</P>
<P>RXXBW Where a breakdown in coherency can occur, data coherency of the caches is controlled in an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED manner.</P>
<P>RJVJN The architecture cannot guarantee whether:<BR>&#8226; A memory location that is present in the cache remains in the cache.<BR>&#8226; A memory location that is not present in the cache is brought into the cache.</P>
<P>RPHWM If the cache is disabled, no new allocation of memory locations into the cache occurs.</P>
<P>RLJQB The allocation of a memory location into a cache cannot cause the most recent value of that memory location to become invisible to an observer, if it had previously been visible to that observer.</P>
<P>RQRLS If the cache is enabled, it is guaranteed that no memory location that does not have a cacheable attribute is allocated into the cache.</P>
<P>RXXVH If the cache is enabled, it is guaranteed that no memory location is allocated to the cache if the access permissions for that location are so that the location cannot be accessed by reads and cannot be accessed by writes.</P>
<P>RSCKQ Any cached memory location is not guaranteed to remain incoherent with the rest of memory.</P>
<P>RRQXN It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether an access can generate a cache hit when the cache is disabled.</P>
<P>RWDBP It is UNPREDICTABLE whether the location is returned from cache or from memory when:<BR>&#8226; The location is not marked as cacheable but is contained in the cache. This situation can occur if a location is marked as Non-cacheable after it has been allocated into the cache.<BR>&#8226; The location is marked as cacheable and might be contained in the cache, but the cache is disabled.</P>
