<P>IVVTX The following table summarizes the Load-Acquire/Store-Release instructions.<BR>Data type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Load-Acquire&nbsp;&nbsp; Store-Release&nbsp;&nbsp; Load-Acquire Exclusive&nbsp;&nbsp; Store-Release Exclusive<BR>32-bit word&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDAEX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STLEX<BR>16-bit halfword&nbsp; LDAH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STLH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDAEXH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STLEXH<BR>8-bit byte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDAB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STLB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDAEXB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STLEXB</P>
<P>RXBRM A Store-Release followed by a Load-Acquire is observed in program order by each observer within the Shareability domain of the memory address being accessed by the Store-Release and the memory address being accessed by the Load-Acquire.</P>
<P>RRRFK For a Load-Acquire, observers in the Shareability domain of the address that is accessed by the Load-Acquire observe accesses in the following order:<BR>1. The read caused by the Load-Acquire.<BR>2. Reads and writes caused by loads and stores that appear in program order after the Load-Acquire for which the Shareability of the address that is accessed by the load or store requires that the observer observes the access.<BR>There are no other ordering requirements on loads or stores that appear before the Load-Acquire.</P>
<P>RWLWT For a Store-Release, observers in the Shareability domain of the address that is accessed by the Store-Release observe accesses in the following order:<BR>1. All of the following for which the Shareability of the address that is accessed requires that the observer observes the access:<BR>&#8226; Reads and writes caused by loads and stores that appear in program order before the Store-Release.<BR>&#8226; Writes that were observed by the PE executing the Store-Release before it executed the Store-Release.<BR>2. The write caused by the Store-Release.<BR>There are no other ordering requirements on loads or stores that appear in program order after the Store-Release.</P>
<P>RHCKC All Store-Release instructions must be multi-copy atomic when they are observed with Load-Acquire instructions.</P>
<P>RDGXR A Load-Acquire to an address in a memory-mapped peripheral of an arbitrary system-defined size that is defined as any type of Device memory access ensures that all memory accesses using Device memory types to the same memory-mapped peripheral that are architecturally required to be observed after the Load-Acquire will arrive at the memory-mapped peripheral after the memory access of the Load-Acquire.</P>
<P>RCKRC A Store-Release to an address in a memory-mapped peripheral of an arbitrary system-defined size that is defined as any type of Device memory access ensures that all memory accesses using Device memory types to the same memory-mapped peripheral that are architecturally required to be observed before the Store-Release will arrive at the memory-mapped peripheral before the memory access of the Store-Release.</P>
<P>RGJHK If a Load-Acquire to a memory address in a memory-mapped peripheral of an arbitrary system-defined size that is defined as any type of Device memory access has observed the value that is stored to that address by a Store-Release, then any memory access to the memory-mapped peripheral that is architecturally required to be ordered before the memory access of the Store-Release will arrive at the memory-mapped peripheral before any memory access to the same peripheral that is architecturally required to be ordered after the memory access of the Load-Acquire.</P>
<P>RWRLC Load-Acquire and Store-Release access only a single data element.</P>
<P>RKCTN Load-Acquire and Store-Release accesses are single-copy atomic.</P>
<P>RBXRP If a Load-Acquire or Store-Release instruction accesses an address that is not aligned to the size of the data element being accessed, the access generates an alignment fault.</P>
<P>RNVRJ A Store-Release Exclusive instruction only has the release semantics if the store is successful.</P>
