B5.19 Shareability attributes</P>
<P>RCJRF Each Normal cacheable memory region is assigned one of the following Shareability attributes:<BR>&#8226; Non-shareable.<BR>&#8226; Inner-shareable.<BR>&#8226; Outer-shareable.</P>
<P>RPDVV For Non-shareable memory, hardware is not required to make data accesses by different observers coherent. If a number of observers share the memory, cache maintenance instructions, in addition to the barrier operations that are required to ensure memory ordering, can ensure that the presence of caches does not lead to coherency issues.</P>
<P>RXTVD Non-cacheable Normal memory locations are always treated as Outer Shareable.</P>
