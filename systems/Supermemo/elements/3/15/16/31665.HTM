B5.20 Memory access restrictions</P>
<P>RKSXT For accesses to any two bytes that are accessed by the same instruction, the two bytes must have the same memory type and Shareability attributes, otherwise the behavior is a CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE choice of the following:<BR>&#8226; All memory accesses that were generated by the instruction use the memory type and Shareability attributes that are associated with the first address that is accessed by the instruction.<BR>&#8226; All memory accesses that were generated by the instruction use the memory type and Shareability attributes that are associated with the last address that is accessed by the instruction.<BR>&#8226; Each memory access that is generated by the instruction uses the memory type and Shareability attribute that is associated with its own address.<BR>&#8226; The instruction executes as a NOP.<BR>&#8226; The instruction generates an alignment fault caused by the memory type.</P>
<P>IWRBT Except for possible differences in cache allocation hints, ARM deprecates having different Cacheability attributes for accesses to any two bytes that are generated by the same instruction.</P>
<P>RBFKS If the accesses of an instruction that cause multiple accesses to any type of Device memory cross the boundary of a memory region then the behavior is a CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE choice of the following:<BR>&#8226; All memory accesses that are generated by the instruction are performed as if the presence of the boundary had no effect on memory accesses.<BR>&#8226; All memory accesses that are generated by the instruction are performed as if the presence of the boundary had no effect on memory accesses, except that there is no guarantee of ordering between memory accesses,<BR>&#8226; The instruction executes as a NOP.<BR>&#8226; The instruction generates an alignment fault caused by the memory type.</P>
