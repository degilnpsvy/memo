B5.17.2 Reordering and non-Reordering Device memory attributes</P>
<P>R attribute</P>
<P>RRPTB This attribute imposes no restrictions or relaxations.</P>
<P>nR attribute</P>
<P>RDFXL If the access is to a:<BR>&#8226; Peripheral, it must arrive at the peripheral in program order. If there is a mixture of accesses to Device nGnRE and Device-nGnRnE in the same peripheral, these accesses must occur in program order.<BR>&#8226; Non-peripheral, this attribute imposes no restrictions or relaxations.</P>
<P>IBDWB The IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED size of the single peripheral is the same as applies for the ordering guarantee that is provided by the DMB instruction.</P>
<P>RNDHC The non-Reordering attribute does not require any additional ordering, other than the ordering that applies to Normal memory, between:<BR>&#8226; Accesses with the non-Reordering attribute and accesses with the Reordering attribute.<BR>&#8226; Accesses with the non-Reordering attribute and accesses to Normal memory.<BR>&#8226; Accesses with the non-Reordering attribute and accesses to different peripherals of IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED size.
