B5.17.3 Early Write Acknowledgement and no Early Write Acknowledgement Device memory attributes</P>
<P>E attribute</P>
<P>RPVSH This attribute imposes no restrictions or relaxations.</P>
<P>nE attribute</P>
<P>RFWFR Assigning the nE attribute recommends that only the endpoint of the write access returns a write acknowledgement of the access, and that no earlier point in the memory system returns a write acknowledgement.</P>
<P>IFQWQ The E attribute is treated as a hint. ARM strongly recommends that this hint is not ignored by a PE, but is made available for use by the system.
