B5.6 Concurrent modification and execution of instructions</P>
<P>ITFGC The ARMv8 architecture limits the set of instructions that can be executed by one thread of execution as they are being modified by another thread of execution without requiring explicit synchronization.</P>
<P>RKMZG The hw1 of a 32-bit BL immediate instruction can be concurrently modified to the most significant halfword of another BL immediate instruction.</P>
<P>RHKGP The hw1 of a 32-bit BL immediate or BLX immediate instruction can be concurrently modified to a 16-bit B, BL, BLX, BKPT, or SVC instruction. This modification also works in reverse.</P>
<P>RFGBT The hw2 of a 32-bit BL immediate instruction can be concurrently modified to the least significant halfword of another BL instruction with a different immediate.</P>
<P>RNTVD The hw2 of a 32-bit B immediate instruction with a condition field can be concurrently modified to the least significant halfword of another 32-bit B immediate instruction with a condition field with a different immediate.</P>
<P>RCMZX The hw2 of a 32-bit B immediate instruction without a condition field can be concurrently modified to the least significant halfword of another 32-bit B immediate instruction without a condition field.</P>
