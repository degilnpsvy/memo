B5.12 Ordering of explicit memory accesses</P>
<P>RBMNM For all memory types, for accesses from a single observer, the requirements of uniprocessor semantics are maintained.</P>
<P>RWTRP For all types of memory, if there is a control dependency between a direct read and a subsequent direct write, the two accesses are observed in program order by any observer in the common Shareability domain of the two accesses.</P>
<P>RXGNP For all types of memory, if the value returned by a direct read computes data that is written by a subsequent direct write, the two accesses are observed in program order by any observer in the common Shareability domain of the two accesses.</P>
<P>RMBNW It is impossible for an observer to observe a write from a store that both:<BR>&#8226; Has not been executed.<BR>&#8226; Will not be executed.</P>
