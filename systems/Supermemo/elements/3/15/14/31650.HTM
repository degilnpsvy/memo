B5.12 Ordering of explicit memory accesses 
<P></P>
<P>RBMNM <FONT class=extract>For all memory types, for accesses from a single observer, the requirements of uniprocessor semantics are maintained.</FONT></P>
<P>RWTRP <FONT class=extract>For all types of memory, if there is a control dependency between a direct read and a subsequent direct write, the two accesses are observed in program order by any observer in the common Shareability domain of the two accesses.</FONT></P>
<P>RXGNP <FONT class=extract>For all types of memory, if the value returned by a direct read computes data that is written by a subsequent direct write, the two accesses are observed in program order by any observer in the common Shareability domain of the two accesses.</FONT></P>
<P>RMBNW <FONT class=extract>It is impossible for an observer to observe a write from a store that both:<BR>&#8226; Has not been executed.<BR>&#8226; Will not be executed.</FONT></P>
