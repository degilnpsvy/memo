B5.5.2 Multi-copy atomicity 
<P></P>
<P>IBCHK <FONT class=extract>In a multiprocessing environment, writes to memory are multi-copy atomic if all of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; All writes to the same location are observed in the same order by all observers, although some of the observers might not observe all of the writes.<BR>&#8226; A read of a location does not return the value of a write to that location until all observers have observed that write.</FONT></P>
<P>RGJGP <FONT class=extract>Writes to Normal memory are not required to be multi-copy atomic.</FONT></P>
<P>RLBGB <FONT class=extract>Writes to Device memory with the Gathering attribute are not required to be multi-copy atomic.</FONT></P>
<P>RWHJR <FONT class=extract>Writes to Device memory with the non-Gathering attribute that are single-copy atomic are also multi-copy atomic.</FONT></P>
