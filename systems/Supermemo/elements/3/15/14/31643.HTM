B5.5.2 Multi-copy atomicity</P>
<P>IBCHK In a multiprocessing environment, writes to memory are multi-copy atomic if all of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; All writes to the same location are observed in the same order by all observers, although some of the observers might not observe all of the writes.<BR>&#8226; A read of a location does not return the value of a write to that location until all observers have observed that write.</P>
<P>RGJGP Writes to Normal memory are not required to be multi-copy atomic.</P>
<P>RLBGB Writes to Device memory with the Gathering attribute are not required to be multi-copy atomic.</P>
<P>RWHJR Writes to Device memory with the non-Gathering attribute that are single-copy atomic are also multi-copy atomic.</P>
