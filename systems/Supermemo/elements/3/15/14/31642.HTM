B5.5.1 Single-copy atomicity 
<P></P>
<P>INWVK <FONT class=extract>Store operations are single-copy atomic if, when they overlap bytes in memory:<BR>1. All of the writes from one of the stores are inserted into the coherence order of each overlapping byte.<BR>2. All of the writes from another of the stores are inserted into the coherence order of each overlapping byte.<BR>3. Step 2 repeats, for each single-copy store atomic operation that overlaps.</FONT></P>
<P>RBSHJ <FONT class=extract>The following data accesses are single-copy atomic:<BR>&#8226; All byte accesses.<BR>&#8226; All halfword accesses to halfword-aligned locations.<BR>&#8226; All word accesses to word-aligned locations.</FONT></P>
<P>RQNPX <FONT class=extract>Instruction fetches are single-copy atomic at halfword granularity.</FONT></P>
<P>RMXWC <FONT class=extract>For instructions that access a sequence of word-aligned words, each word access is single-copy atomic.</FONT></P>
<P>RLKPM <FONT class=extract>For instructions that access a sequence of word-aligned words, the architecture does not require two or more subsequent word accesses to be single-copy atomic.</FONT>
