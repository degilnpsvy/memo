B5.9 Completion of memory accesses</P>
<P>RXCTL A read or write is complete for a Shareability domain when the following conditions are true:<BR>&#8226; The read or write is globally observed for that Shareability domain.<BR>&#8226; All instruction fetches by observers within the Shareability domain have observed the read or write.</P>
<P>RWCMQ A cache or branch predictor maintenance instruction is complete for a Shareability domain when the effects of the instruction are globally observed for that Shareability domain.</P>
<P>RSFLM The completion of a memory access to Device memory other than Device-nGnRnE does not guarantee the visibility of the side-effects of the access to all observers.</P>
<P>RMWBK The mechanism that ensures the visibility of the side-effects of the access to all observers is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.</P>
