B5.10 Ordering requirements for memory accesses</P>
<P>RRBDL ARMv8-M defines access restrictions in the permitted ordering of memory accesses. These restrictions depend on the memory attributes of the accesses involved.</P>
<P>RGJDH For all accesses to all memory types, the only stores by an observer that can be observed by another observer are those stores that have been architecturally executed.</P>
<P>RRXPL Reads and writes can be observed in any order provided that, if an address dependency exists between two reads or between a read and a write, then those memory accesses are observed in program order by all observers within the common Shareability domain of the memory addresses being accessed.</P>
<P>RKWFG Speculative writes by an observer cannot be observed by another observer.</P>
<P>RVMHG For Device memory with the non-Reordering attribute, memory accesses arrive at a single peripheral in program order.</P>
<P>RWGCF Memory accesses caused by instruction fetches are not required to be observed in program order, unless they are separated by a Context synchronization event.</P>
<P>RRJMK A register data dependency between the value that is returned by a load instruction and the address that is used by a subsequent memory transaction creates order between that load instruction and the subsequent memory transaction.</P>
