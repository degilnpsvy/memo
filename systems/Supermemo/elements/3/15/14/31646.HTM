B5.8 Observability of memory accesses 
<P></P>
<P>RPNDH <FONT class=extract>For a PE, the following mechanisms are treated as independent observers:<BR>&#8226; The mechanism that performs reads from or writes to memory.<BR>&#8226; The mechanism that causes an instruction cache to be filled from memory or that fetches instructions to be executed directly from memory. These accesses are treated as reads.</FONT></P>
<P>RDVFW <FONT class=extract>The set of observers that can observe a memory access is defined by the system.</FONT></P>
<P>IVSCK <FONT class=extract>In the context of observability, subsequent means whichever of the following descriptions is appropriate:<BR>&#8226; After the point in time where the location is observed by the observer.<BR>&#8226; After the point in time where the location is globally observed.</FONT></P>
<P>RVCCS <FONT class=extract>A write to a location in memory is observed by an observer when:<BR>&#8226; A subsequent read of the location by the same observer returns the value that was written by the observed write or written by a write to that location by any observer that is sequenced in the coherence order of the location after the observed write.<BR>&#8226; A subsequent write of the location by the same observer is sequenced in the coherence order of the location after the observed write.</FONT></P>
<P>RXQPT <FONT class=extract>A write to a location in memory is globally observed for a Shareability domain or set of observers when:<BR>&#8226; A subsequent read of the location by any observer in that Shareability domain that is capable of observing the write returns the value that is written by the globally observed write or by a write to that location by any observer that is sequenced in the coherence order of the location after the globally observed write.<BR>&#8226; A subsequent write to the location by any observer in that Shareability domain is sequenced in the coherence order of the location after the globally observed write.</FONT></P>
<P>RRSPX <FONT class=extract>For Device-nGnRnE memory, a read or write of a memory-mapped location in a peripheral is observed, and globally observed, only when the read or write:<BR>&#8226; Meets the general observability conditions.<BR>&#8226; Can begin to affect the state of the memory-mapped peripheral.<BR>&#8226; Can trigger all associated side-effects, whether they affect other peripheral devices, PEs, or memory.</FONT></P>
<P>RDGRR <FONT class=extract>A read of a location in memory is observed by an observer when a subsequent write to the location by the same observer has no effect on the value that is returned by the read.</FONT></P>
<P>RBVJF <FONT class=extract>A read of a location in memory is globally observed for a Shareability domain when a subsequent write to the location by any observer in that Shareability domain that is capable of observing the write has no effect on the value that is returned by the read.</FONT></P>
