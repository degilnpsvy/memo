<P>IJHGH An instruction fetch or memory access is subject to the following checks in the following order:<BR>1. Alignment.<BR>2. SAU.<BR>3. MPU.<BR>4. BusFault (IBUSERR).</P>
<P>RTQJS An exception is generated, instead of normal execution of the fetching and decoding process, if one of the following occurs.<BR>Priority(Cause):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fault type<BR>Highest(AU violation): One of the following Secure faults:<BR>&#8226; INVEP<BR>&#8226; INVTRAN <BR>&#8595;(MPU violation): The following MemManage fault:<BR>&#8226; IACCVIOL<BR>&#8595;(System fault): The following BusFault:<BR>&#8226; IBUSERR<BR>&#8595;(FPB hit) One of the following:<BR>&#8226; DebugMonitor<BR>&#8226; Halted Debug Entry<BR>&#8595;(SG check) The following SecureFault:<BR>&#8226; INVEP<BR>&#8595;(T32 state check) The following UsageFault:<BR>&#8226; INVSTATE<BR>Lowest(Undefined instruction) One of the following UsageFaults:<BR>&#8226; UNDEFINSTR<BR>&#8226; NOCP</P>
<P>RKPNQ If a memory access fails its alignment check, the fetch is not presented to the SAU.</P>
<P>RSDMQ If an instruction fetch or memory access fails its AU check, the fetch is not presented to the relevant MPU for comparison.</P>
<P>RFLLN If an instruction fetch or memory access fails its MPU check, it is not issued to the memory system.</P>
