B6.1 Exclusive access instructions</P>
<P>RLQDX ARMv8 provides non-blocking synchronization of shared memory, using synchronization primitives for accesses to both Normal and Device memory.</P>
<P>RRGCP The synchronization primitives and associated instructions are as follows:<BR>Function: T32 instruction<BR>Load-Exclusive<BR>Byte:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDREXB, LDAEXB<BR>Halfword: LDREXH, LDAEXH<BR>Word:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LDREX, LDAEX<BR>Store-Exclusive<BR>Byte:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STREXB, STLEXB<BR>Halfword: STREXH, STLEXH<BR>Word:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; STREX, STLEX<BR>Clear-Exclusive CLREX</P>
<P>RMWFP A Load-Exclusive instruction performs a load from memory, and:<BR>&#8226; The executing PE marks the memory address for exclusive access.<BR>&#8226; The local monitor of the executing PE transitions to the Exclusive Access state.</P>
<P>RJHMH The size of the marked memory block is called the Exclusives reservation granule (ERG), and is an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED value that is of a power of 2 size, in the range 4 - 512 words.</P>
<P>RMTTN A marked block of the ERG is created by ignoring the least significant bits of the memory address. A marked address is any address within this marked block.</P>
<P>RFMXK In some implementations the CTR identifies the Exclusives reservation granule. Where this is not the case, the Exclusives reservation granule is treated as having the maximum of 512 words.</P>
