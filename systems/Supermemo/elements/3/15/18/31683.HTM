B6.2 The local monitors 
<P></P>
<P>RQTFP Any non-aborted attempt by the same PE to use a Store-Exclusive instruction to modify any address is guaranteed to clear the marking.</P>
<P>RNJWC When a PE writes using any instruction other than a Store-Exclusive instruction:<BR>&#8226; If the write is to a physical address that is not marked as Exclusive Access by its local monitor and that local monitor is in the Exclusive Access state, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the write affects the state of the local monitor.<BR>&#8226; If the write is to a physical address that is marked as Exclusive Access by its local monitor, it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the write affects the state of the local monitor.</P>
<P>RPFFT It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether a store to a marked physical address causes a mark in the local monitor to be cleared if that store is by an observer other than the one that caused the physical address to be marked.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>RKXNM The state machine for the local monitor is shown here.<BR>The local monitor only transitions to the Exclusive Access state as the result of the architectural execution of one of the operations shown in the diagram.<BR>Any transition of the local monitor to the Open Access state that is not caused by the architectural execution of an operation shown here does not indefinitely delay forward progress of execution.</FONT></P>
<P>RWTHJ The local monitor does not hold any physical address, but instead treats any access as matching the address of the previous Load-Exclusive instruction.</P>
<P>RJWQS A local monitor implementation can be unaware of Load-Exclusive and Store-Exclusive instructions from other PEs.</P>
<P>RKJQW The architecture does not require a load instruction by another PE that is not a Load-Exclusive instruction to have any affect on the local monitor.</P>
<P>RXMML It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether the transition from Exclusive Access to Open Access state occurs when the Store or StoreExcl is from another observer.</P>
<P>RMRSD The architecture permits a local monitor to transition to the Open Access state as a result of speculation, or from some other cause.</P>
<P>RHRHC An exception return clears the local monitor.</P>
