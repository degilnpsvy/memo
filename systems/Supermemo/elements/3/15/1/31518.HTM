* Memory mapped registers &#8211; The memory mapped address range 0xE002E000 -&gt; 0xE002EFFF is an alias of the SCS registers (0xE000E000 -&gt; 0xE000EFFF), however unless otherwise specified accesses to these aliases from the secure state behave as if the access came from the non-secure state and target the non-secure versions of the registers. Accesses from the debugger or software executing in the non-secure state behave as if the aliases did not exist (i.e. RAZ/WI if the access is privileged, and a BusFault is raised if the access is unprivileged).
