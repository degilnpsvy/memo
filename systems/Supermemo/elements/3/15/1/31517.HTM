* Core registers &#8211; Setting the <FONT class=clozed>MSB of the address (i.e. SYSm[8])</FONT> for accesses from the secure states selects the non-secure version of the register. 
<P></P>
<P>E.g. SYSm = 0x8 access the main stack pointer for the current state, where as SYSm = 0x88 accesses the non-secure version of the main stack pointer. Accesses from the non-secure state with the MSB set behave as RAZ/WI.
