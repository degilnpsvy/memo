B5.13 Memory barriers
<P></P>
<P>RWRCT The ARM architecture supports out-of-order completion of instructions.</P>
<P>RGKDW ARMv8 supports the following memory barriers:<BR>&#8226; Instruction Synchronization Barrier (ISB).<BR>&#8226; Data Memory Barrier (DMB).<BR>&#8226; Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB).</P>
<P>RLQXF The DMB and DSB memory barriers affect reads and writes to the memory system that are generated by Load/Store instructions and data or unified cache maintenance instructions that are executed by the PE. Instruction fetches are not explicit accesses.
