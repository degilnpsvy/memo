B5.17.1 Gathering and non-Gathering Device memory attributes</P>
<P>G attribute<BR>RDBSX If multiple accesses of the same type, read or write, are to:<BR>&#8226; The same location, with the G attribute, they can be merged into a single transaction.<BR>&#8226; Different locations, all with the G attribute, they can be merged into a single transaction.</P>
<P>RKCMX Gathering of accesses that are separated by a memory barrier is not permitted.</P>
<P>RJSRD Gathering of accesses that are generated by a Load-Acquire/Store-Release is not permitted.</P>
<P>RMGKJ A read can come from intermediate buffering of a previous write if:<BR>&#8226; The accesses are not separated by a DMB or DSB barrier.<BR>&#8226; The accesses are not separated by any other ordering construction that requires that the accesses are in order, for example a combination of Load-Acquire and Store-Release.<BR>&#8226; The accesses are not generated by a Store-Release instruction.</P>
<P>ISRDS The architecture only defines programmer visible behavior. Therefore, if a programmer cannot tell whether gathering has occurred, gathering can be performed.</P>
<P>nG attribute</P>
<P>RGVTF Multiple accesses to a memory location with the nG attribute cannot be merged into a single transaction.</P>
<P>RBTWD A read of a memory location with the nG attribute cannot come from a cache or a buffer, but must come from the endpoint for that address in the memory system.</P>
