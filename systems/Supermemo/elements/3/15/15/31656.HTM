B5.14 Normal memory</P>
<P>INVRF Memory locations that are idempotent have the following properties:<BR>&#8226; Read accesses can be repeated with no side-effects.<BR>&#8226; Repeated read accesses return the last value that is written to the resource being read.<BR>&#8226; Read accesses can fetch additional memory locations with no side-effects.<BR>&#8226; Write accesses can be repeated with no side-effects, if the contents of the location that is accessed are unchanged between the repeated writes or as the result of an exception.<BR>&#8226; Unaligned accesses can be supported.<BR>&#8226; Accesses can be merged before accessing the target memory system.</P>
<P>RRYTG Normal memory is a memory type that is assigned to regions of memory that are idempotent.</P>
<P>RCGJX Normal memory can be marked as Cacheable or Non-cacheable. Normal memory must be assigned Cacheability attributes.</P>
<P>RLCPJ Normal Non-cacheable memory is always treated as shareable.</P>
<P>RPKXL Speculative data accesses to Normal memory are permitted.</P>
<P>RWLVR A write to Normal memory completes in finite time.</P>
<P>RWLCV A write to a Non-cacheable Normal memory location must reach the endpoint for that location in the memory system in finite time.</P>
<P>RMJWF A completed write to Normal memory is globally observed for the Shareability domain in finite time without the requirement for cache maintenance instructions or memory barriers.</P>
<P>RNHFQ For multi-register Load/Store instructions that access Normal memory, the architecture does not define the order in which the registers are accessed.</P>
<P>RCFHV There is no requirement for the memory system beyond the PE to be able to identify the size of the elements accessed.</P>
