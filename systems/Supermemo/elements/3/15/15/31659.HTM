B5.17 Device memory attributes</P>
<P>RVNSJ Each Device memory region is assigned a combination of Device memory attributes. The attributes are<BR>Gathering, G and nG<BR>&nbsp; The Gathering and non-Gathering attributes.<BR>Reordering, R and nR<BR>&nbsp; The Reordering and non-Reordering attributes.<BR>Early Write Acknowledgement, E and nE<BR>&nbsp; The Early Write Acknowledgement and no Early Write Acknowledgement attributes.<BR>&nbsp; <BR>RCFFC Each Device memory region is assigned one of the combinations in the following table:<BR>Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nG nR nE G R E<BR>Device-nGnRnE Y&nbsp; Y&nbsp; Y&nbsp; - - -<BR>Device-nGnRE&nbsp; Y&nbsp; Y&nbsp; -&nbsp; - - Y<BR>Device-nGRE&nbsp;&nbsp; Y&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; - Y Y<BR>Device-GRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; -&nbsp; Y Y Y</P>
<P>ISJBD Device-nGnRnE is the most constrained, so it is the strongest. Device-GRE is the least constrained, so it is the weakest. Going down the table, the combinations are described as getting weaker.</P>
<P>RLJKD Weaker memory can be accessed according to the rules specified for stronger memory:<BR>&#8226; Memory with the:<BR>&#8213; G attribute can be accessed according to the rules specified for the nG attribute.<BR>&#8213; nG attribute cannot be accessed according to the rules specified for the G attribute.<BR>&#8226; Memory with the:<BR>&#8213; R attribute can be accessed according to the rules specified for the nR attribute.<BR>&#8213; nR attribute cannot be accessed according to the rules specified for the R attribute.<BR>Because the nE attribute is a hint:<BR>&#8226; An implementation is permitted to perform an access with the E attribute in a manner consistent with the requirements specified by the nE attribute.<BR>&#8226; An implementation is permitted to perform an access with the nE attribute in a manner consistent with the relaxations allowed by the E attribute.</P>
<P>RFJXX For Device-GRE and Device-nGRE memory, the use of barriers is required to order accesses.</P>
