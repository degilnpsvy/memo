B5.13.2 Data Memory Barrier</P>
<P>RMPSG The required Shareability for a DMB is Full system, and applies to all observers in the Shareability domain.</P>
<P>RGVDL A DMB only affects memory accesses and the operation of data cache and unified cache maintenance instructions, and has no effect on the ordering of any other instructions.</P>
<P>RHFTX A DMB that ensures the completion of cache maintenance instructions has an access type of both loads and stores.</P>
<P>RWMRT A DMB instruction creates two groups of memory accesses, Group A and Group B, and does not affect memory accesses that are in not in Group A or Group B:<BR>Group A Contains:<BR>&#8226; All explicit memory accesses of the required access types from observers in the same Shareability domain as PEe that are observed by PEe before the DMB instruction.<BR>&#8226; All loads of required access types from an observer PEx in the same required Shareability domain as PEe that have been observed by any given different observer, PEy, in the same required Shareability domain as PEe before PEy has performed a memory access that is a member of Group A.<BR>Group B Contains:<BR>&#8226; All explicit memory accesses of the required access types by PEe that occur in program order after the DMB instruction.<BR>&#8226; All explicit memory accesses of the required access types by any given observer PEx in the same required Shareability domain as PEe that can only occur after a load by PEx has returned the result of a store that is a member of Group B.<BR>Any observer with the same required Shareability domain as PEe observes all members of Group A before it observes any member of Group B to the extent that those group members are required to be observed, as determined by the Shareability and Cacheability of the memory addresses accessed by the group members.<BR>If members of Group A and members of Group B access the same memory-mapped peripheral of arbitrary system-defined size, then members of Group A that are accessing Device or Normal Non-cacheable memory arrive at that peripheral before members of Group B that are accessing Device or Normal Non-cacheable memory. Where the members of Group A and Group B that must be ordered are from the same PE, a DMB provides for this guarantee.<BR>See also:<BR>&#8226; DataMemoryBarrier().<BR>&#8226; Shareability domains on page B5-139.
