B5.16 Device memory</P>
<P>IBXHS Device memory is a memory type that is assigned to regions of memory where accesses can have side-effects.</P>
<P>RWTZL Device memory is not cacheable.</P>
<P>RLDDN Device memory is always treated as shareable.</P>
<P>RPQXS Speculative data accesses cannot be made to Device memory. However, for instructions that access a sequence of word-aligned words, the accesses might occur multiple times.</P>
<P>RNLHC Speculative instruction fetches can be made to Device memory, unless the location is marked as Execute-never.</P>
<P>RCSKG Any unaligned access to Device memory generates an UNALIGNED UsageFault exception.</P>
<P>RYMTK Device memory is assigned a combination of Device memory attributes.</P>
<P>RLFTG A write to Device memory completes in finite time.</P>
<P>RFSCD A write to a Device memory location reaches the endpoint for that location in the memory system in finite time.</P>
<P>RGTTQ A completed write to a Device memory location is globally observed for the Shareability domain in finite time without the requirement for cache maintenance instructions or barriers.</P>
<P>RXMCH If the content of a Device memory location changes without a direct write to the location, the change must be observed for the Shareability domain in finite time.</P>
<P>RKJHG For an instruction fetch from Device memory, if a branch causes the program counter to point to an area of memory that is not marked as Execute-never, the implementation can either:<BR>&#8226; Treat the fetch as if it is to a location in Normal Non-cacheable memory.<BR>&#8226; Take an IACCVIOLL MemManage fault.</P>
<P>RDFJX There is no requirement for the memory system beyond the PE to be able to identify the size of the elements that are accessed, for instructions that load the following from Device memory:<BR>&#8226; More than one general-purpose register.<BR>&#8226; One or more registers from the floating-point register file.</P>
<P>RKVHT For an LDM, STM, LDRD, or STRD instruction with a register list that includes the PC, the architecture does not define the order in which the registers are accessed.</P>
<P>RSFPK For a LDM, STM, VLDM, or VSTM instruction with a register list that does not include the PC, all registers are accessed in the order that they appear in the register list, for Device memory with the non-Reordering attribute.</P>
