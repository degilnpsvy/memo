B5.15 Cacheability attributes</P>
<P>RKXJV The architecture provides Cacheability attributes that are defined independently for each of two conceptual levels of cache:<BR>&#8226; The Inner cache.<BR>&#8226; The Outer cache.</P>
<P>RXRWS The Cacheability attributes are:<BR>&#8226; Non-cacheable.<BR>&#8226; Write-Through Cacheable.<BR>&#8226; Write-Back Cacheable.</P>
<P>RXQXW It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether Write-Through Cacheable and Write-Back Cacheable can have the additional attribute Transient or Non-transient.</P>
<P>ILDXP The Transient attribute is a memory hint that indicates that the benefit of caching is for a short period. The architecture does not define what is meant by a short period.</P>
<P>RCFKN Cacheability attributes other than Non-cacheable can be complemented by the following cache allocation hints, which are independent for read and write accesses:<BR>&#8226; Read-Allocate, Transient Read-Allocate, or No Read-Allocate.<BR>&#8226; Write-Allocate, Transient Write-Allocate, or No Write-Allocate.</P>
<P>RDRTR The architecture does not require an implementation to make any use of cache allocation hints.</P>
<P>RFQSS Any cacheable Normal memory region is treated as Read-Allocate, No Write-Allocate unless it is explicitly assigned other cache allocation hints.</P>
<P>IFRVF A Cacheable location with no Read-Allocate and no Write-Allocate hints is not the same as a Non-cacheable location. A Non-cacheable location has coherency guarantees for all observers within the system that do not apply to a location that is Cacheable, no Read-Allocate, no Write-Allocate.</P>
<P>RFTKW All data accesses to Non-cacheable Normal memory locations are data coherent to all observers,</P>
