B5.2 Address space</P>
<P>RFFMK The address space is a single, flat address space of 232 bytes.</P>
<P>RSNPV In the address space, byte addresses are unsigned numbers in the range 0-232-1.</P>
<P>RRGBT If an address calculation overflows or underflows the address space, it wraps around. Address calculations are modulo 232.</P>
<P>IJTKM Normal sequential execution cannot overflow the top of the address space, because the top of memory always has the Execute Never (XN) memory attribute.</P>
<P>RBPMP LDC, LDM, LDRD, POP, PUSH, STC, STRD, STM, VLDM, VPOP, VPUSH, VSTM, VLDR.64, and VSTR.64 instructions access a sequence of words at increasing memory addresses, effectively incrementing the address by 4 for each load or store. If this calculation overflows the top of the address space, the result is UNPREDICTABLE.</P>
