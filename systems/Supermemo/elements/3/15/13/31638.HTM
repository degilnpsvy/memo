B5.2 Address space 
<P></P>
<P>RFFMK <FONT class=extract>The address space is a single, flat address space of 2^32 bytes.</FONT></P>
<P>RSNPV In the address space, byte addresses are unsigned numbers in the range 0-2^32-1.</P>
<P>RRGBT <FONT class=extract>If an address calculation overflows or underflows the address space, it wraps around. Address calculations are modulo 2^32.</FONT></P>
<P>IJTKM <FONT class=extract>Normal sequential execution cannot overflow the top of the address space, because the top of memory always has the Execute Never (XN) memory attribute.</FONT></P>
<P>RBPMP <FONT class=extract>LDC, LDM, LDRD, POP, PUSH, STC, STRD, STM, VLDM, VPOP, VPUSH, VSTM, VLDR.64, and VSTR.64 instructions access a sequence of words at increasing memory addresses, effectively incrementing the address by 4 for each load or store. If this calculation overflows the top of the address space, the result is UNPREDICTABLE.</FONT></P>
