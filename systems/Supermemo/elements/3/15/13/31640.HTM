B5.4 Alignment behavior</P>
<P>RLKGV All instruction fetches are halfword-aligned.</P>
<P>RGHRX The following are unaligned data accesses that always generate an alignment fault:<BR>&#8226; Non halfword-aligned LDREXH, LDAEXH, STLEXH, and STREXH.<BR>&#8226; Non word-aligned LDREX, LDAEX, STLEX, and STREX.<BR>&#8226; Non word-aligned LDR (literal), LDRD, LDMIA, LDMDB, POP, LDC, VLDR, VLDM, and VPOP.<BR>&#8226; Non word-aligned STMIA, STMDB, PUSH, STC, VSTR, VSTM, VPUSH, VLLDM, and VLSTM.</P>
<P>RMHCM If CCR.UNALIGN_TRP is set to 1, the following are unaligned data accesses that generate an alignment fault:<BR>&#8226; Non halfword-aligned LDR{S}H{T}, LDAH, STLH, and STRH{T}.<BR>&#8226; Non halfword-aligned TBH.<BR>&#8226; Non word-aligned LDR{T}, LDA, STL, and STR{T}.</P>
<P>RTRNR Unaligned accesses are only supported if the Main Extension is implemented. If the Main Extension is not implemented unaligned access generate an alignment fault.</P>
<P>RWCVX Accesses to Device memory are always aligned.</P>
<P>RRNDS Alignment faults are synchronous and generate an UNALIGNED UsageFault.</P>
