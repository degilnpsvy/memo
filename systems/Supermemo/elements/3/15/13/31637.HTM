B5.1 Memory accesses</P>
<P>IXRDS The memory accesses that are referred to in describing the memory model are instruction fetches from memory and load or store data accesses.</P>
<P>RLKQN The instruction operation uses the MemA[] or MemU[] helper functions. If the Main Extension is not implemented unaligned accesses using the MemU[] helper functions generate an alignment fault.</P>
<P>RBFNF A memory access is governed by whether the access is a read or write, its address alignment, data endianness, and memory attributes.</P>
