B5.1 Memory accesses 
<P></P>
<P>IXRDS <FONT class=extract>The memory accesses that are referred to in describing the memory model are instruction fetches from memory and load or store data accesses.</FONT></P>
<P>RLKQN <FONT class=extract>The instruction operation uses the MemA[] or MemU[] helper functions. If the Main Extension is not implemented unaligned accesses using the MemU[] helper functions generate an alignment fault.</FONT></P>
<P>RBFNF <FONT class=extract>A memory access is governed by whether the access is a read or write, its address alignment, data endianness, and memory attributes.</FONT></P>
