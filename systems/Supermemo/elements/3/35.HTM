<P>&nbsp;Even with a great deal of experience and perfect understanding of knowledge structure, you will meet items that by no means want to stick to your memory. Usually 60% of items will not even be forgotten once! However, there are always a few items that you might forget 10 times, or even 20 times. 5% of your items may cost you 80% of your learning time (and 99% of frustration). </P>
<P>In most cases, the fault is with you, the items must simply be reformulated (see: 20 rules of formulating knowledge). However, some items just seem un-memorizable! Those do not indicate your memory is bad! They are a usual companion of every learning process, and you must roll out the heavy guns to deal with them. </P>
<P>You will use whatever mnemonic technique comes to mind: add examples, illustrations, poke fun, make it indecent or shocking, create a mind-map, re-memorize with a longer interval (this will often break the unhealthy memory connection) or, in most desperate cases, delete the item altogether. </P>
<P>Any items with above 20 memory lapses makes a good candidate for deleting. Such an item may simply not be worth the cost in your time. To find out which options can help you hunt for trouble-making items see: Leeches
