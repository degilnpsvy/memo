In a PE with the Floating-point Extension:<BR>&#8226; Because setting FPCCR.ASPEN to 1 causes the PE to automatically set CONTROL.FPCA to 1 on the execution of a floating-point instruction, setting FPCCR.ASPEN to 1 means that the PE hardware automatically either:<BR>&#8213; Stacks FP context on taking an exception.<BR>&#8213; Uses lazy FP context preservation on taking an exception.<BR>If CONTROL.FPCA is 1, it is FPCCR.LSPEN that determines which of the above the PE hardware performs:<BR>0 The PE hardware automatically stacks FP context on taking an exception. In a PE that also includes the Security Extension, if FPCCR_S.TS is 1, the hardware stacks the additional FP context as well as the FP context.<BR>1 The PE hardware uses lazy FP context preservation on taking an exception, and sets all of :<BR>&#8226; The FPCAR, to point to the reserved S0 stack address.<BR>&#8226; FPCCR.LSPACT to 1.<BR>&#8226; FPCCR.{USER, THREAD, HFREADY, MMRDY, BFRDY, SFRDY, MONRDY, UFRDY}, to record the permissions and fault possibilities to be applied to any subsequent FP context save.<BR>In a PE that also includes the Security Extension, if FPCCR_S.TS is 1, the hardware reserves space on the stack for both the FP context and the additional FP context. Otherwise, the hardware only reserves space on the stack for the FP context.
