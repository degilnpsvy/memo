If FPCCR_S.TS is 0 when the exception is taken, the PE hardware either stacks the FP context or reserves space on the stack for the FP context.<BR>If FPPCR_S.TS is 1 when the exception is taken, the PE hardware either stacks both the FP context and additional FP context, or reserves space on the stack for both the FP context and additional FP context.<BR>3. If exception entry is to Non-secure state, including when a higher priority derived or late-arriving exception targeting Secure state occurs, the PE hardware extends the stack frame and also saves the additional state context.

<P>The following figure shows PE stacking behavior when CONTROL.FPCA is 1, FPPCR_S.TS is 1 (and both the FP context and additional FP context is stacked), and exception entry is to Non-secure state:
