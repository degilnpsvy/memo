If software attempts to execute a floating-point instruction while lazy FP context preservation is active, the access permissions that CPACR and NSACR define are checked against the context that activated lazy FP context preservation, as stored in the FPCCR.<BR>&#8226; If no permission violation is detected, the PE:<BR>1. Saves FP context to the reserved area on the stack, as identified by the FPCAR.<BR>2. Sets FPCCR.LSPACT to 0 to indicate that lazy FP context preservation is no longer active.<BR>3. Processes the floating-point instruction.<BR>&#8226; If a permission violation is detected, the PE generates a NOCP UsageFault and does not save FP context to the reserved area on the stack.<BR>This check is performed regardless of whether the Security Extension is implemented.
