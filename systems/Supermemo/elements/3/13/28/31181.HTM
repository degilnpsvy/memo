In a PE without the Security Extension and without the Floating-point Extension (regardless of whether the Main Extension is implemented), on taking an exception, the PE hardware saves state context onto the stack that the SP register points to. The state context that is saved is eight 32-bit words:<BR>&#8226; RETPSR.<BR>&#8226; ReturnAddress.<BR>&#8226; R14. This is the Link Register (LR).<BR>&#8226; R12.<BR>&#8226; R3-R0.
