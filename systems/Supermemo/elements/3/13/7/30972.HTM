Typing <TT class="docutils literal">ex25.</TT> is annoying. A shortcut is to do your import like this: <TT class="docutils literal"><FONT class=clozed>from ex25 import *</FONT></TT> which is like saying, "Import everything from <TT class="docutils literal">ex25</TT>." Programmers like saying things backward. Start a new session and see how all your functions are right there.
