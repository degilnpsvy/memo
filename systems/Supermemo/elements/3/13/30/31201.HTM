The PE begins an exception return when both of the following are true:<BR>&#8226; The PE is in Handler mode.<BR>&#8226; One of the following instructions loads an EXC_RETURN value, 0xFFXXXXXX, into the PC:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; A POP or LDM that includes loading the PC.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; An LDR with the PC as a destination.<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; A BX with any register.<BR>When both of these are true, then on detecting an EXC_RETURN value in the PC, the PE unstacks the stack and resumes execution of the code that was preempted by the exception handler.<BR>If an EXC_RETURN value is loaded into the PC by an instruction other than those listed, or from the vector table, the value is treated as an address.<BR>If an EXC_RETURN value is loaded into the PC when the PE is in Thread mode, the value is treated as an address.
