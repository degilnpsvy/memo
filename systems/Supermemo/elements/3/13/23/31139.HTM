B4.32.1 Instruction-related lockup behavior</P>
<P>Instruction execution<BR>RVGMR A synchronous exception results in lockup when:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The synchronous exception would escalate to a Secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; NMI is active and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The synchronous exception would escalate to a Non-secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Non-secure HardFault or Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; NMI is active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; FAULTMASK_NS.FM or FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>RVGNW Entry to lockup from an exception causes:<BR>&#8226; Any Fault Status Registers associated with the exception to be updated.<BR>&#8226; No update to the exception state, pending or active.<BR>&#8226; The PC to be set to 0xEFFFFFFE.<BR>&#8226; EPSR.IT to be become UNKNOWN.<BR>In addition, HFSR.FORCED is not set to 1.<BR>RDWKP Asynchronous BusFaults never cause lockup. The standard rules for asynchronous BusFaults are applied.<BR>IXXKW When a BusFault does not cause lockup, the value read or written to the location that generated the BusFault is UNKNOWN.</P>
<P>Floating-point lazy FP context preservation<BR>RRNKB When FPCCR.LSPACT is 1, a NOCP UsageFault, SAU violation, MPU violation, or synchronous bus error during lazy FP context preservation causes lockup if any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; FPCCR.HFRDY is 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The exception would escalate to a Secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; NMI is active and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Non-secure Hardfault is active and AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is 0.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The exception would escalate to a Non-secure HardFault and any of the following is true:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; Non-secure HardFault or Secure HardFault is already active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; NMI is active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; FAULTMASK_NS.FM or FAULTMASK_S.FM is 1.<BR>RMMBJ When FPCCR.LSPEN is 0, any faults caused by floating-point register reads or writes during exception entry or exception return are handled as faults on stacking or unstacking respectively.<BR>RXFQJ When FPCCR.LSPEN is 1 and a NOCP UsageFault, SAU violation, MPU violation, or synchronous bus error during FP context stacking causes lockup, that entry to lockup causes:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Any Fault Status Registers associated with the exception to be updated.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; No update to the exception state, pending or active.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; The PC to be set to 0xEFFFFFFE.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; EPSR.IT to be become UNKNOWN.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, HFSR.FORCED is not set to 1.
