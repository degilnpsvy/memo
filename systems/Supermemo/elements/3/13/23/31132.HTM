B4.26 Exceptions during exception return 
<P></P>
<P>IKXPV <FONT class=extract>During exception return exceptions can occur, for example asynchronous exceptions, or the exception return might itself cause an exception.<BR>Any exception that occurs during exception return is a late-arriving exception.<BR>When the exception return sequence itself causes an exception, the latter exception is a derived exception.<BR></FONT>RTRFM <FONT class=extract>When a late-arriving exception during exception return is higher priority than the priority being returned to, the PE takes the late-arriving exception by using tail-chaining.</FONT><BR>IMBNG <FONT class=extract>The architecture does not specify the point during exception return at which the PE recognizes the arrival of an asynchronous exception. If a PE recognizes an asynchronous exception after an exception return has completed, there is no opportunity to tail-chain the asynchronous exception.</FONT><BR>RMJDN <FONT class=extract>If the priority of a derived exception during exception return is equal to or lower than the priority being returned to:<BR>&#8226; If the derived exception is a DebugMonitor exception, the PE ignores the derived exception.<BR>&#8226; Otherwise, the PE escalates the derived exception to Hardfault and the escalated exception is tail-chained.</FONT><BR>RDHFK <FONT class=extract>If the priority of a derived exception during exception return, after priority escalation if appropriate, is higher priority than the priority being returned to, the PE uses tail-chaining to take the derived exception.</FONT><BR>See also:<BR>&#8226; Exception numbers and exception priority numbers on page B4-46.<BR>&#8226; Priority model on page B4-56.<BR>&#8226; Exception return on page B4-73.<BR>&#8226; Tail-chaining on page B4-79.
