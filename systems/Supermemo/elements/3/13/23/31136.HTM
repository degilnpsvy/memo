B4.30 Hardware-controlled priority escalation to HardFault 
<P></P>
<P>RGNVS <FONT class=extract>When current execution has a priority number &#8805;0:<BR>&#8226; If a synchronous exception with an equal or lower priority is pending, the PE hardware escalates it to become a HardFault. This rule applies to all synchronous exceptions and DebugMonitor exceptions caused by the BKPT instruction. This rule does not apply to asynchronous exceptions and all other DebugMonitor exceptions.</FONT><BR>RPBJQ <FONT class=extract>When current execution has a priority number &gt;= 0, if a disabled software configurable priority exception occurs:<BR>&#8226; If it is a synchronous exception, the PE hardware escalates the exception to become a HardFault.<BR>&#8226; If it is an interrupt, the PE does not escalate the interrupt. The interrupt remains pending.</FONT></P>
<P>RDQRR <FONT class=extract>A fault that has been escalated to a HardFault retains the return address behavior of the original fault.</FONT>
