<DT>Why does <TT class="docutils literal">for i in range(1, 3):</TT> <FONT class=clozed>only loop two times instead of three times? </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=clozed>The <TT class="docutils literal">range()</TT> function only does numbers from the first to the last, <EM>not including the last</EM>. So it stops at two, not three in the above. This turns out to be the most common way to do this kind of loop.</FONT></DD>
