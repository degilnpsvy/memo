<DT>Aren't lists and arrays the same thing? 
<DD>Depends on the language and the implementation. In classic terms a list is very different from an array because of how they're implemented. In Ruby though they call these arrays. In Python they call them lists. Just call these lists for now since that's what Python calls them.</DD>
