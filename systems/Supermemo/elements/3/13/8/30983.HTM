<LI>Every <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statement</SPAN></TT> must have an <TT class="docutils literal">else</TT>. 
<LI>If this <TT class="docutils literal">else</TT> should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a <TT class="docutils literal">die</TT> function in the <TT class="docutils literal">else</TT> that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find <EM>many</EM> errors. </LI>
