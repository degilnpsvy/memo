The following is an example of exceptions with different priorities:<BR>Example B4-1<BR>This example considers the following exceptions, that all have software configurable priority numbers:<BR>&#8226; A has the highest priority.<BR>&#8226; B has medium priority.<BR>&#8226; C has lowest priority.<BR>Example sequence of events:<BR>1. No exception is active and no priority boosting is active.<BR>2. B is generated. The PE takes exception B and starts executing the handler for it. Exception B is now active and the current execution priority is that of B.<BR>3. A is generated. A is higher priority, therefore A preempts B and the PE starts executing the handler for A. Exception A is now active and the current execution priority is that of A. Exception B remains active.<BR>4. C is generated. C has the lowest priority, therefore it is pending.<BR>5. The PE reduces the priority of A to a priority that is lower than C. B is now the highest priority active exception, therefore the execution priority moves to that of B. <FONT class=clozed>The PE continues executing the handler for A at the priority of B. After completing A</FONT>, the PE restarts the handler for B. After completing B, the PE takes exception C and starts executing the handler for it. C is now active and the current execution priority is that of C.
