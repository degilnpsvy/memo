<H1 class=title>Exercise 28: Boolean Practice</H1>
<P id=p1>The logic combinations you learned from the last exercise are called "boolean" logic expressions. Boolean logic is used <EM>everywhere</EM> in programming. It is a fundamental part of computation and knowing them very well is akin to knowing your scales in music.</P>
<P id=p2>In this exercise you will take the logic exercises you memorized and start trying them out in Python. Take each of these logic problems and write what you think the answer will be. In each case it will be either True or False. Once you have the answers written down, you will start Python in your Terminal and type each logic problem in to confirm your answers.</P>

<P id=p3>I will also give you a trick to help you figure out the more complicated ones toward the end.</P>
<P id=p4>Whenever you see these boolean logic statements, you can solve them easily by this simple process:</P>
<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth. 
<LI>Find each <TT class="docutils literal">and/or</TT> inside parentheses and solve those first. 
<LI>Find each <TT class="docutils literal">not</TT> and invert it. 
<LI>Find any remaining <TT class="docutils literal">and/or</TT> and solve it. 
<LI>When you are done you should have True or False.</LI></OL>

<P id=p17 class=last>The more complicated ones may seem <EM>very</EM> hard at first. You should be able to give a good first stab at solving them, but do not get discouraged.

<LI>There are a lot of operators in Python similar to <TT class="docutils literal">!=</TT> and <TT class="docutils literal">==</TT>. Try to find as many "equality operators" as you can. They should be like <TT class="docutils literal">&lt;</TT> or <TT class="docutils literal">&lt;=</TT>. 
<LI>Write out the names of each of these equality operators. For example, I call <TT class="docutils literal">!=</TT> "not equal." 
<LI>Play with the Python by typing out new boolean operators, and before you press Enter try to shout out what it is. Do not think about it. Shout the first thing that comes to mind. Write it down, then press Enter, and keep track of how many you get right and wrong.

<H1>Common Student Questions</H1>
<DL class=docutils>
<DT><FONT class=extract>Why does <TT class="docutils literal">"test" and "test"</TT> return <TT class="docutils literal">"test"</TT> or <TT class="docutils literal">1 and 1</TT> return <TT class="docutils literal">1</TT> instead of <TT class="docutils literal">True</TT>? </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=extract>Python and many languages like to return one of the operands to their boolean expressions rather than just <TT class="docutils literal">True</TT> or <TT class="docutils literal">False</TT>. This means that if you did <TT class="docutils literal">False and 1</TT> you get the first operand (<TT class="docutils literal">False</TT>) but if you do <TT class="docutils literal">True and 1</TT> your get the second (<TT class="docutils literal">1</TT>). Play with this a bit.</FONT> 
<DT><FONT class=extract>Is there any difference between <TT class="docutils literal">!=</TT> and <TT class="docutils literal">&lt;&gt;</TT>? </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=extract>Python has deprecated <TT class="docutils literal">&lt;&gt;</TT> in favor of <TT class="docutils literal">!=</TT>, so use <TT class="docutils literal">!=</TT>. Other than that there should be no difference.</FONT> 
<DT>Isn't there a shortcut? 
<DD>Yes. Any <TT class="docutils literal">and</TT> expression that has a <TT class="docutils literal">False</TT> is immediately <TT class="docutils literal">False</TT>, so you can stop there. Any <TT class="docutils literal">or</TT> expression that has a <TT class="docutils literal">True</TT> is immediately <TT class="docutils literal">True</TT>, so you can stop there. But make sure that you can process the whole expression because later it becomes helpful.</DD></DL></DIV>
