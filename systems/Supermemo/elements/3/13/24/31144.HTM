B4.36 Context Synchronization Operation</P>
<P>IQVJV A context synchronization operation (CSO) is one of:<BR>&#8226; Performing an ISB operation. An ISB operation is performed when an ISB instruction is executed and does not fail its condition check.<BR>&#8226; Taking an exception.<BR>&#8226; Returning from an exception.<BR>&#8226; Entering Debug state.<BR>&#8226; Exiting Debug state.<BR>Security state transitions are not context synchronization operations.<BR>RQXWD The architecture requires a CSO to guarantee visibility of any change to a system control register.<BR>RTVHX Between any change to a System control register and a subsequent CSO, it is UNPREDICTABLE whether an indirect read of the register by the PE uses the old or new values.
