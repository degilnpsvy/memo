<H1 class=title>Exercise 1: A Good First Program</H1>
<DIV class=warning>
<P id=p1 class="first admonition-title">Warning</P>
<P id=p2 class=last>If you skipped Exercise 0 then you are not doing this book right. You must read every single thing I write here and read it carefully. For example, are you trying to use Python 3 for this book? I said in Exercise 0 to not use Python 3, so you should <EM>not</EM> use Python 3. Are you trying to use IDLE or an IDE? I said not to use one in Exercise 0, so you should not use one. If you skipped Exercise 0 please go back to it and read it.</P></DIV>
<P id=p3>You should have spent a good amount of time in Exercise 0 learning how to install a text editor, run the text editor, run the Terminal, and work with both of them. If you haven't done that, then do not go on. You will not have a good time. This is the only time I'll start an exercise with a warning that you should not skip or get ahead of yourself.</P>
<P id=p4>Type the following text into a single file named <TT class="docutils literal">ex1.py</TT>. Python works best with files ending in <TT class="docutils literal">.py</TT>.</P>

<P id=p5>Your <TT class="docutils literal">Atom</TT> text editor should look something like this on all platforms:</P>
<DIV class="figure align-center"><IMG alt=_static/python/osx_atom.png src="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/_static/python/osx_atom.png"> </DIV>
<P id=p6>Don't worry if your editor doesn't look exactly the same, it should be close though. You may have a slightly different window header, maybe slightly different colors, and the left side of your <TT class="docutils literal">Atom</TT> window won't say "zedshaw" but will instead show the directory you used for saving your files. All of those differences are fine.</P>
<P id=p7>When you create this file, keep in mind these points:</P>
<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>I did not type the line numbers on the left. Those are printed in the book so I can talk about specific lines by saying, "See line 5..." You do not type line numbers into Python scripts.</LI>
<LI>I have the <TT class="docutils literal">print</TT> at the beginning of the line and it looks exactly the same as what I have in <TT class="docutils literal">ex1.py</TT>. Exactly means exactly, not kind of sort of the same. Every single character has to match for it to work. Color doesn't matter, only the characters you type.</LI></OL>
<P id=p8>In Terminal <EM>run</EM> the file by typing:</P><PRE class="code console literal-block"><SPAN class="generic output">python ex1.py</SPAN>
</PRE>
<P id=p9>If you did it right then you should see the same output as I in the <EM>What You Should See</EM> section of this exercise. If not, you have done something wrong. No, the computer is not wrong.</P>
<DIV id=what-you-should-see class=section>
<H1>What You Should See</H1>
<P id=p10>On Mac OS X in the Terminal you should see this:</P>
<DIV class="figure align-center"><IMG alt=_static/python/osx_terminal_ex1.png src="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/_static/python/osx_terminal_ex1.png"> </DIV>
<P id=p11>On Windows in PowerShell you should see this:</P>
<DIV class="figure align-center"><IMG alt=_static/python/win_powershell_ex1.png src="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/_static/python/win_powershell_ex1.png"> </DIV>
<P id=p12>You may see different names, before the <TT class="docutils literal">python ex1.py</TT> command, but the important part is that you type the command and see the output is the same as mine.</P>
<P id=p13>If you have an error it will look like this:</P><PRE class=literal-block>$ python ex/ex1.py
  File "ex/ex1.py", line 3
    print "I like typing this.
                             ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal
</PRE>
<P id=p14>It's important that you can read these error messages because you will be making many of these mistakes. Even I make many of these mistakes. Let's look at this line by line.</P>
<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>We ran our command in the Terminal to run the <TT class="docutils literal">ex1.py</TT> script.</LI>
<LI>Python tells us that the file <TT class="docutils literal">ex1.py</TT> has an error on line 3.</LI>
<LI>It prints this line of code for us to see it.</LI>
<LI>Then it puts a <TT class="docutils literal">^</TT> (caret) character to point at where the problem is. Notice the missing <TT class="docutils literal">"</TT> (double-quote) character?</LI>
<LI>Finally, it prints out a "SyntaxError" and tells us something about what might be the error. Usually these are very cryptic, but if you copy that text into a search engine, you will find someone else who's had that error and you can probably figure out how to fix it.</LI></OL>
<DIV class=warning>
<P id=p15 class="first admonition-title">Warning</P>
<P id=p16>If you are from another country, and you get errors about ASCII encodings, then put this at the top of your Python scripts:</P><PRE class=literal-block># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</PRE>
<P id=p17 class=last>It will fix them so that you can use Unicode UTF-8 in your scripts without a problem.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=study-drills class=section>
<H1>Study Drills</H1>
<P id=p18>The Study Drills contain things you should <EM>try</EM> to do. If you can't, skip it and come back later.</P>
<P id=p19>For this exercise, try these things:</P>
<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>Make your script print another line.</LI>
<LI>Make your script print only one of the lines.</LI>
<LI>Put a <TT class="docutils literal">#</TT> (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.</LI></OL>
<P id=p20>From now on, I won't explain how each exercise works unless an exercise is different.</P>
<DIV class=note>
<P id=p21 class="first admonition-title">Note</P>
<P id=p22 class=last>An "octothorpe" is also called a "pound", "hash", "mesh", or any number of names. Pick the one that makes you chill out.</P></DIV></DIV>
<DIV id=common-student-questions class=section>
<H1>Common Student Questions</H1>
<P id=p23>These are <EM>actual</EM> questions that real students have asked when doing this exercise.</P>
<DL class=docutils>
<DT>Can I use IDLE?</DT>
<DD>No, you should use Terminal on OS X and PowerShell on Windows, just like I have here. If you don't know how to use those, then you can go read the Command Line Crash Course in Appendix A.</DD>
<DT>How do you get colors in your editor?</DT>
<DD>Save your file first as a <TT class="docutils literal">.py</TT> file, such as <TT class="docutils literal">ex1.py</TT>. Then you'll have color when you type.</DD>
<DT>I get <TT class="docutils literal">SyntaxError: invalid syntax</TT> when I run ex1.py.</DT>
<DD>You are probably trying to run Python, then trying to type Python again. Close your Terminal, start it again, and right away type only <TT class="docutils literal">python ex1.py</TT>.</DD>
<DT>I get <TT class="docutils literal">can't open file 'ex1.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory</TT>.</DT>
<DD>You need to be in the same directory as the file you created. Make sure you use the <TT class="docutils literal">cd</TT> command to go there first. For example, if you saved your file in <TT class="docutils literal">lpthw/ex1.py</TT>, then you would do <TT class="docutils literal">cd lpthw/</TT> before trying to run <TT class="docutils literal">python ex1.py</TT>. If you don't know what any of that means, then go through <EM>Appendix A</EM>.</DD>
<DT>How do I get my country's language characters into my file?</DT>
<DD>Make sure you type this at the top of your file: <TT class="docutils literal"># <SPAN class=pre>-*-</SPAN> coding: <SPAN class=pre>utf-8</SPAN> <SPAN class=pre>-*-</SPAN></TT>.</DD>
<DT>My file doesn't run; I just get the prompt back with no output.</DT>
<DD>You most likely took the code in my <TT class="docutils literal">ex1.py</TT> file literally and thought that <TT class="docutils literal">print "Hello World!"</TT> meant to type only <TT class="docutils literal">"Hello World!"</TT> into the file, without the <TT class="docutils literal">print</TT>. Your file has to be <EM>exactly</EM> like mine.</DD></DL></DIV>
