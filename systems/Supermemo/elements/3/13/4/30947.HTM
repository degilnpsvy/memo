<P id=p9>Here's how you memorize things:</P>
<UL class=simple>
<LI>Tell yourself you <EM>will</EM> do it. Don't try to find tricks or easy ways out of it, just sit down and do it. 
<LI>Write what you want to memorize on some index cards. Put one half of what you need to learn on one side, then another half on the other side. 
<LI>Every day for about 15-30 minutes, drill yourself on the index cards, trying to recall each one. Put any cards you don't get right into a different pile, just drill those cards until you get bored, then try the whole deck and see if you improve. 
<LI>Before you go to bed, drill just the cards you got wrong for about 5 minutes, then go to sleep.</LI></UL>
