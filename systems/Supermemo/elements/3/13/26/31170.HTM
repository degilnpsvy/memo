INTID, bits [8:0], on a write<BR>Interrupt ID. Indicates the interrupt to be pended. The value written is (ExceptionNumber - 16).<BR>Writing to this register has the same effect as setting the NVIC_ISPRn bit corresponding to the interrupt to 1. Like NVIC_ISPRn, an attempt to pend an interrupt targeting Secure state from Non-secure is ignored.
