D2.2.168 PC, Program Counter
<P></P>
<P>The PC characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Holds the current program counter value.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged and unprivileged access permitted.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write special-purpose register. This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>VALUE, bits [31:0]<BR>Program counter. Holds the address of the current instruction plus four. Software can refer to PC as R15. This field resets to an UNKNOWN value on a Warm reset.<BR>Note<BR>In general, ARM strongly recommends using the names SP, LR and PC instead of R13, R14 and R15. However, sometimes it is simpler to use the R13-R15 names when referring to a group of registers. For example, it is simpler to refer to registers R8 to R15, rather than to registers R8 to R12, the SP, LR and PC. These two descriptions of the group of registers have exactly the same meaning.
