D2.2.167 NVIC_ITNS&lt;n&gt;, Interrupt Target Non-secure Register, n = 0 - 15
<P></P>
<P>The NVIC_ITNS&lt;n&gt; characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: For each group of 32 interrupts, determines whether each interrupt targets Non-secure or Secure state.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault. This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: This register is always implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write register located at 0xE000E380 + 4n.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RAZ/WI when accessed as Non-secure.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The NVIC_ITNS&lt;n&gt; bit assignments are:<BR>ITNS, bits [31:0]<BR>Interrupt Targets Non-secure. For ITNS[m] in NVIC_ITNSn, this field indicates and allows modification of the target Security state for interrupt 32n+m.<BR>The possible values of each bit are:<BR>0 Interrupt targets Secure state.<BR>1 Interrupt targets Non-secure state.<BR>Bits corresponding to unimplemented interrupts are RES0. It is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether individual bits are WI and have an IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED constant value. Where an interrupt is configured to target Secure state, accesses to the associated fields in Non-secure versions of the NVIC_IABR, NVIC_ICER, NVIC_ISER, NVIC_ICPR, NVIC_IPR and NVIC_ISPR are RAZ/WI.<BR>This field resets to zero on a Warm reset.
