If an interstating branch generates a change from Secure state to Non-secure state, then before the Security state change:<BR>&#8226; <FONT class=clozed>The return address, which is the address of the instruction after the instruction that caused the function call, the IPSR value, and CONTROL.SFPA are stored onto the current stack, as shown in the following figure. ReturnAddress[0] is set to 1 to indicate a return to the T32 Instruction set state. The IPSR is stacked in the partial RETPSR, and CONTROL.SFPA is stacked in bit [20] of the partial RETPSR.</FONT>
