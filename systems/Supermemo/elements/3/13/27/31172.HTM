If sequential instruction execution crosses from Non-secure memory to Secure memory, then if the Secure memory entry point contains an SG instruction and the whole of the instruction at the Secure memory entry point is flagged as Secure and Non-secure callable, it is CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE whether:<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; The PE changes to Secure state.<BR>&nbsp; &#8226; A fault is generated:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; An INVEP SecureFault in a PE with the Main Extension.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; A Secure HardFault in a PE without the Main Extension.
