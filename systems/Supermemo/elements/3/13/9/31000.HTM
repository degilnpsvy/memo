If the PE enters a low-power state on a WFE instruction, it remains in that low-power state until it receives a WFE wakeup event. When the PE recognizes a WFE wakeup event, the WFE instruction completes. The following are WFE wakeup events:<BR>&#8226; The execution of a SEV instruction by any PE.<BR>&#8226; When SCR.SEVONPEND is 1, any exception entering the pending state.<BR>&#8226; Any exception at a priority that would preempt the current execution priority, taking into account any active exceptions and including the effects of any software-controlled priority booting by AIRCR.PRIS == 1 and PRIMASK, FAULTMASK, or BASEPRI.<BR>&#8226; If debug is enabled, a debug event.
