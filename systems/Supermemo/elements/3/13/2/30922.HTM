<H1 class=title>Exercise 30: Else and If</H1>
<P id=p1>In the last exercise you worked out some <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statement</SPAN></TT> and then tried to guess what they are and how they work. Before you learn more I'll explain what everything is by answering the questions you had from Study Drills. You did the Study Drills right?</P>
<OL class="arabic simple">
<LI>What do you think the <TT class="docutils literal">if</TT> does to the code under it? An <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statement</SPAN></TT> creates what is called a "branch" in the code. It's kind of like those choose your own adventure books where you are asked to turn to one page if you make one choice, and another if you go a different direction. The <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statement</SPAN></TT> tells your script, "If this boolean expression is True, then run the code under it, otherwise skip it."</LI>
<LI>Why does the code under the <TT class="docutils literal">if</TT> need to be indented four spaces? A colon at the end of a line is how you tell Python you are going to create a new "block" of code, and then indenting four spaces tells Python what lines of code are in that block. This is <EM>exactly</EM> the same thing you did when you made functions in the first half of the book.</LI>
<LI>What happens if it isn't indented? If it isn't indented, you will most likely create a Python error. Python expects you to indent <EM>something</EM> after you end a line with a <TT class="docutils literal">:</TT> (colon).</LI>
<LI>Can you put other boolean expressions from Exercise 27 in the <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statement</SPAN></TT>? Try it. Yes you can, and they can be as complex as you like, although really complex things generally are bad style.</LI>
<LI>What happens if you change the initial values for <TT class="docutils literal">people</TT>, <TT class="docutils literal">cats</TT>, and <TT class="docutils literal">dogs</TT>? Because you are comparing numbers, if you change the numbers, different <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statements</SPAN></TT> will evaluate to <TT class="docutils literal">True</TT> and the blocks of code under them will run. Go back and put different numbers in and see if you can figure out in your head which blocks of code will run.</LI></OL>
<P id=p2>Compare my answers to your answers, and make sure you <EM>really</EM> understand the concept of a "block" of code. This is important for when you do the next exercise where you write all the parts of <TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>if-statements</SPAN></TT> that you can use.</P>
<P id=p3>Type this one in and make it work too.</P>
