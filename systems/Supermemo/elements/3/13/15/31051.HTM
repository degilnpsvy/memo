D2.2.103 <FONT class=extract>HFSR, HardFault Status Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The HFSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Shows the cause of any HardFaults.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000ED2C.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via HFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED2C. The location 0xE002ED2C is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P>The HFSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>DEBUGEVT, bit [31]<BR>Debug event. Indicates when a Debug event has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No Debug event has occurred.<BR>1 Debug event has occurred. The Debug Fault Status Register has been updated.<BR>The PE sets this bit to 1 only when halting debug is disabled and a Debug event occurs. When AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set to zero, the Non-secure view of this bit is RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>FORCED, bit [30]<BR>Forced. Indicates that a fault with configurable priority has been escalated to a HardFault exception, because it could not be made active, because of priority, or because it was disabled.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No priority escalation has occurred.<BR>1 Processor has escalated a configurable-priority exception to HardFault.<BR>When AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set to zero, the Non-secure view of this bit is RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P>Bits [29:2]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>VECTTBL, bit [1]<BR>Vector table. Indicates when a fault has occurred because of a vector table read error on exception processing.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No vector table read fault has occurred.<BR>1 Vector table read fault has occurred.<BR>When AIRCR.BFHFNMINS is set to zero, the Non-secure view of this bit is RAZ/WI.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</FONT></P>
<P>Bit [0]<BR>Reserved, RES0.
