D2.2.7 BFSR, BusFault Status Register 
<P></P>
<P>The BFSR characteristics are:<BR><FONT class=extract>Purpose: Shows the status of bus errors resulting from instruction fetches and data accesses.</FONT><BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 8-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000ED29.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via BFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED29. The location 0xE002ED29 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.<BR>&nbsp; This register is part of CFSR.</P>
<P>The BFSR bit assignments are:<BR>BFARVALID, bit [7]<BR>BFAR valid. Indicates validity of the contents of the BFAR register.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 BFAR content not valid.<BR>1 BFAR content valid.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bit [6]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>LSPERR, bit [5]<BR>Lazy state preservation error. Records whether a BusFault occurred during FP lazy state preservation.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No BusFault occurred.<BR>1 BusFault occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>STKERR, bit [4]<BR>Stack error. Records whether a derived BusFault occurred during exception entry stacking.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No derived BusFault occurred.<BR>1 Derived BusFault occurred during exception entry.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>UNSTKERR, bit [3]<BR>Unstack error. Records whether a derived BusFault occurred during exception return unstacking.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No derived BusFault occurred.<BR>1 Derived BusFault occurred during exception return.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>IMPRECISERR, bit [2]<BR>Imprecise error. Records whether an imprecise data access error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No imprecise data access error has occurred.<BR>1 Imprecise data access error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>PRECISERR, bit [1]<BR>Precise error. Records whether a precise data access error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No precise data access error has occurred.<BR>1 Precise data access error has occurred.<BR>When a precise error is recorded, the associated address is written to the BFAR and BFSR.BFARVALID bit is set.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>IBUSERR, bit [0]<BR>Instruction bus error. Records whether a BusFault on an instruction prefetch has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 No BusFault on instruction prefetch has occurred.<BR>1 A BusFault on an instruction prefetch has occurred.<BR>An IBUSERR is only recorded if the instruction is issued for execution.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
