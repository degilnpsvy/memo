D2.2.216 UFSR, UsageFault Status Register</P>
<P>The UFSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Contains the status for some instruction execution faults, and for data access faults.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is implemented, this register is word, halfword, and byte accessible.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented, this register is word accessible only, halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 16-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000ED2A.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via UFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED2A. The location 0xE002ED2A is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is banked between Security states.<BR>&nbsp; This register is part of CFSR.</P>
<P>The UFSR bit assignments are:</P>
<P>Bits [15:10]<BR>Reserved, RES0.<BR>DIVBYZERO, bit [9]<BR>Divide by zero flag. Sticky flag indicating whether an integer division by zero error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>UNALIGNED, bit [8]<BR>Unaligned access flag. Sticky flag indicating whether an unaligned access error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>Bits [7:5]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>STKOF, bit [4]<BR>Stack overflow flag. Sticky flag indicating whether a stack overflow error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>NOCP, bit [3]<BR>No coprocessor flag. Sticky flag indicating whether a coprocessor disabled or not present error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>INVPC, bit [2]<BR>Invalid PC flag. Sticky flag indicating whether an integrity check error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>INVSTATE, bit [1]<BR>Invalid state flag. Sticky flag indicating whether an EPSR.T or EPSR.IT validity error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.</P>
<P>UNDEFINSTR, bit [0]<BR>Undefined instruction flag. Sticky flag indicating whether an undefined instruction error has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Error has not occurred.<BR>1 Error has occurred.<BR>This includes attempting to execute an undefined instruction associated with an enable coprocessor.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
