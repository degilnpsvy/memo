D2.2.37 <FONT class=extract>DFSR, Debug Fault Status Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The DFSR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Shows which debug event occurred.<BR>Usage constraints: Privileged access permitted only. Unprivileged accesses generate a BusFault.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>&nbsp; If the Main Extension is not implemented then it is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED whether this register is accessible only to the debugger and RES0 for software.<BR>Configurations: Present only if halting debug or the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if both halting debug and Main Extension are not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit read/write-one-to-clear register located at 0xE000ED30.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via DFSR_NS located at 0xE002ED30. The location 0xE002ED30 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</FONT></P>
<P>The DFSR bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:5]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>EXTERNAL, bit [4]<BR>External event. Sticky flag indicating whether an External debug request debug event has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Debug event has not occurred.<BR>1 Debug event has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>VCATCH, bit [3]<BR>Vector Catch event. Sticky flag indicating whether a Vector catch debug event has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Debug event has not occurred.<BR>1 Debug event has occurred.<BR>If halting debug is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>DWTTRAP, bit [2]<BR>Watchpoint event. Sticky flag indicating whether a Watchpoint debug event has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Debug event has not occurred.<BR>1 Debug event has occurred.<BR>If the DWT is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>BKPT, bit [1]<BR>Breakpoint event. Sticky flag indicating whether a Breakpoint debug event has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Debug event has not occurred.<BR>1 Debug event has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>HALTED, bit [0]<BR>Halt or step event. Sticky flag indicating that a Halt request debug event or Step debug event has occurred.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 Debug event has not occurred.<BR>1 Debug event has occurred.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Cold reset.</FONT>
