When a WFI instruction is executed, the PE can suspend execution and enter a low-power state. If it does, it remains in that state until it receives a WFI wakeup event. When the PE recognizes a WFI wakeup event, the WFI instruction completes. The following are WFI wakeup events:<BR>&#8226; A reset.<BR>&#8226; Any asynchronous exception at a priority that, ignoring the effect of PRIMASK (so that behavior is as if PRIMASK is 0), would preempt any currently active exceptions.<BR>&#8226; An IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED WFI wakeup event.<BR>&#8226; If debug is enabled, a debug event.
