Floating-point context active. Defines whether the FP Extension is active in the current context.<BR>This bit is not banked between Security states.<BR>The possible values of this bit are:<BR>0 FP Extension is not active.<BR>1 FP Extension is active.<BR>When NSACR.CP10 is set to zero, the Non-secure view of this bit is read-only. If FPCCR.ASPEN is set to 1, enabling automatic Floating-point state preservation, then the PE sets this bit to 1 on successful completion of any Floating-point instruction.<BR>If the Floating-point Extension is not implemented, this bit is RES0.<BR>This bit resets to zero on a Warm reset.
