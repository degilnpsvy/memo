D2.2.187 <FONT class=extract>STIR, Software Triggered Interrupt Register</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>The STIR characteristics are:<BR>Purpose: Provides a mechanism for software to generate an interrupt.<BR>Usage constraints: Unprivileged accesses generate a fault if CCR.USERSETMPEND is zero.<BR>&nbsp; This register is word accessible only. Halfword and byte accesses are UNPREDICTABLE.<BR>Configurations: Present only if the Main Extension is implemented.<BR>&nbsp; This register is RES0 if the Main Extension is not implemented.<BR>Attributes: 32-bit write-only register located at 0xE000EF00.<BR>&nbsp; Secure software can access the Non-secure view of this register via STIR_NS located at 0xE002EF00. The location 0xE002EF00 is RES0 to software executing in Non-secure state and the debugger.<BR>&nbsp; This register is not banked between Security states.</P>
<P>The STIR bit assignments are:<BR>Bits [31:9]<BR>Reserved, RES0.</P>
<P>INTID, bits [8:0], on a write<BR>Interrupt ID. Indicates the interrupt to be pended. The value written is (ExceptionNumber - 16).<BR>Writing to this register has the same effect as setting the NVIC_ISPRn bit corresponding to the interrupt to 1. Like NVIC_ISPRn, an attempt to pend an interrupt targeting Secure state from Non-secure is ignored.</P>
<P>INTID, bits [8:0], on a read<BR>This field reads as zero.
