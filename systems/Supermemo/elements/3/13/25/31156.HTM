For a branch to an address in the other Security state, the following table shows when the PE changes Security state: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Current Security state -&gt; Security attribute of the branch target address: Security state change</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Secure -&gt; Non-secure:<BR>Change to Non-secure state if the branch was an interstating branch instruction, BXNS or BLXNS, with the lsb of its target address set to 0.<BR>Otherwise:<BR>&#8226; In a PE with the Main Extension, an INVTRAN SecureFault is generated.<BR>&#8226; In a PE without the Main Extension, a Secure HardFault is generated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Non-secure -&gt; Secure and Non-secure callable:<BR>Change to Secure state if both:<BR>&#8226; The branch target address contains an SG instruction.<BR>&#8226; The whole of the instruction at the branch target address is flagged as Secure and Non-secure callable.<BR>Otherwise:<BR>&#8226; In a PE with the Main Extension, an INVEP SecureFault is generated.<BR>&#8226; In a PE without the Main Extension, a Secure HardFault is generated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Non-secure -&gt; Secure and not Non-secure callable:<BR>In a PE with the Main Extension, an INVEP SecureFault is generated.<BR>In a PE without the Main Extension, a Secure Hardfault is generated.</FONT>
