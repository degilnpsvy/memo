<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;You are most likely to use HTML text components in incremental reading (if you do not have the latest Internet Explorer, use rich text components instead). HTML components make text processing easy due to rich formatting. However, once your items assume their final shape,<FONT class=extract> you might prefer to convert them to plain text components which are faster and consume less space. You can do it by selecting the Classic template as the default template in your target category (see: Using categories)</FONT>. You can use several different SuperMemo components to represent text. To understand pros and cons of using various text components see: Text components used in SuperMemo. See also: Fonts in SuperMemo
