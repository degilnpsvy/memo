For all memory, the ARMv7-M completion rules are defined as:<BR>&#8226; A read or write is complete for a shareability domain when all of the following are true:<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; the read or write is globally observed for that shareability domain<BR>&nbsp; &#8213; any instruction fetches by observers within the shareability domain have observed the read or write.<BR>&#8226; A cache or branch predictor maintenance operation is complete for a shareability domain when the effects of operation are globally observed for that shareability domain.
