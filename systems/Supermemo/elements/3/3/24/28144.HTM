<P>The C99 draft contains the following language, about the use of the word "qualified":</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Any type so far mentioned is an unqualified type. Each unqualified type has several qualified versions of its type, corresponding to the combinations of one, two, or all three of the <CODE>const</CODE>, <CODE>volatile</CODE>, and <CODE>restrict</CODE> qualifiers.</P>
<P>The qualified or unqualified versions of a type are distinct types that belong to the same type category and have the same representation and alignment requirements.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So your quote says that an argument having a <CODE>const int</CODE> must match a value of type <CODE>int</CODE>, and so on.</P></DIV></FONT>
