<P>[1] HFNMIENA<BR>When the ENABLE bit is set to 1, controls whether handlers executing with priority less than 0 access memory with the MPU enabled or with the MPU disabled. This applies to HardFaults, NMIs, and exception handlers when FAULTMASK is set to 1:<BR>0 = Disables the MPU for these handlers.<BR>1 = Use the MPU for memory accesses by these handlers.<BR>If HFNMIENA is set to 1 when ENABLE is set to 0, behavior is UNPREDICTABLE.
