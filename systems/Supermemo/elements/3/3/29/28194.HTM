NVIC
<P></P>
<P>B3.4 Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller, NVIC<BR>ARMv7-M provides an interrupt controller as an integral part of the ARMv7-M exception model. The<BR>interrupt controller operation aligns with the ARM General Interrupt Controller (GIC) specification,<BR>defined for use with other ARMv7 profiles and other architectures.<BR>The ARMv7-M NVIC architecture supports up to 496 interrupts. The number of external interrupt lines<BR>supported can be determined from the read-only Interrupt Controller Type Register (ICTR) accessed at<BR>address 0xE000E004 in the System Control Space. See Interrupt Controller Type Register, ICTR on<BR>page B3-741 for the register detail. The general registers associated with the NVIC are all accessible
