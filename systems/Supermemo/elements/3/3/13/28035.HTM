of SFSR Secure Fault Status Register
<P></P>
<P>Secure fault address valid. This bit is set when the SFAR register contains a valid value. Like similar fields (eg BFSR.BFARVALID, and MMFSR.MMARVALID) this bit may be cleared by other exceptions (eg BusFault). NOTE: This field is not set for SAU/IDAU faults caused by vector fetches.
