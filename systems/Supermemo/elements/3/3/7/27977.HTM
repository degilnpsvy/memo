*Supervisor call (SVCall) (Of ARMv7-M&nbsp;exception categories)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT class=extract>An exception caused explicitly by the SVC instruction.</FONT> Application software uses the SVC instruction to make a call to an underlying operating system. This is called a Supervisor call. The SVC instruction enables the application to issue a Supervisor call that requires privileged access to the system and executes in program order with respect to the application.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ARMv7-M also supports an interrupt-driven Supervisor-calling mechanism, PendSV, see Overview of the exceptions supported on page B1-631.
