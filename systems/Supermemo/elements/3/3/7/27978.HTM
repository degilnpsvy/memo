*Fault (Of ARMv7-M&nbsp;exception categories)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <FONT class=extract>A fault is an exception that results from an error condition in instruction execution.</FONT> A fault can be reported synchronously or asynchronously to the instruction that caused it. In general, faults are reported synchronously. <FONT class=extract>The Imprecise BusFault is an asynchronous fault supported in the ARMv7-M profile.</FONT><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A synchronous fault is always reported with the instruction that caused the fault. The architecture makes no guarantee about how an asynchronous fault is reported relative to the instruction that caused the fault.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synchronous debug monitor exceptions are faults. Debug watchpoints are asynchronous and are treated as an interrupt.
