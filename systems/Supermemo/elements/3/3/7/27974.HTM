********* 64-bit guest on 32-bit host support 
<P></P>
<P>The following opcodes are internal to TCG. Thus they are to be implemented by 32-bit host code generators, but are not to be emitted by guest translators. They are emitted as needed by inline functions within "tcg-op.h". </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>* brcond2_i32 t0_low, t0_high, t1_low, t1_high, cond, label </P>
<P>Similar to brcond, except that the 64-bit values T0 and T1 are formed from two 32-bit arguments. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>* setcond2_i32 dest, t1_low, t1_high, t2_low, t2_high, cond </P>
<P>Similar to setcond, except that the 64-bit values T1 and T2 are formed from two 32-bit arguments. The result is a 32-bit value.
