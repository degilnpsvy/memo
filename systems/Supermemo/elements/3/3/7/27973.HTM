<P>* add2_i32/i64 t0_low, t0_high, t1_low, t1_high, t2_low, t2_high </P>
<P>* sub2_i32/i64 t0_low, t0_high, t1_low, t1_high, t2_low, t2_high </P>
<P>Similar to add/sub, except that the double-word inputs T1 and T2 are formed from two single-word arguments, and the double-word output T0 is returned in two single-word outputs. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>* mulu2_i32/i64 t0_low, t0_high, t1, t2 </P>
<P>Similar to mul, except two unsigned inputs T1 and T2 yielding the full double-word product T0. The later is returned in two single-word outputs. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>* muls2_i32/i64 t0_low, t0_high, t1, t2 </P>
<P>Similar to mulu2, except the two inputs T1 and T2 are signed.
