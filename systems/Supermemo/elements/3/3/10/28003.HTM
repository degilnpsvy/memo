<P><FONT class=clozed>Invalid transition. This exception is raised when an invalid exit from the secure state is detected (E.G. a branch that is not flagged as being a domain crossing causes a transition from secure to non-secure memory, linear instruction fetch that crosses from secure to non-secure memory, the exception return address targets non-secure memory when returning to the secure state, etc).</FONT>
