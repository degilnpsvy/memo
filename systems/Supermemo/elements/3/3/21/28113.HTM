ARMv7-M requires three explicit memory barriers to support the memory order model described in this chapter. The three memory barriers are:<BR><FONT class=clozed>&#8226; Data Memory Barrier, see Data Memory Barrier (DMB)<BR>&#8226; Data Synchronization Barrier, see Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) on page A3-117<BR>&#8226; Instruction Synchronization Barrier, see Instruction Synchronization Barrier (ISB) on page A3-118. </FONT>

<P><FONT class=clozed>The DMB and DSB memory barriers affect reads and writes to the memory system generated by load and store instructions. Instruction fetches are not explicit accesses and are not affected</FONT>.
