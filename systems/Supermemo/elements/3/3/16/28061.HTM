5.4.2 FNC_RETURN</P>
<P>The function return value is defined as:<BR>Bits [31-1] This value identifies the value in a PC load as a FNC_RETURN<BR>S Bit[0] Indicates whether the function call was from the non-secure or secure stack. Since FNC_RETURN is only used when calling from the secure state, this bit is always set to 1. However some function chaining cases can result in a SG instruction clearing this bit, so the architecture ignores the state of this bit when processing a branch to FNC_RETURN.</P>
<P>NOTE: Implementations must check bits[31:1] of the target address when detecting FNC_RETURN. This is to prevent the possibility of magic signature (see section 6.3.1) or values used to seal the stack (see section 5.4.1) being interpreted as FNC_RETURN, which could lead to a security vulnerability.
