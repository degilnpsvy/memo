6 EXCEPTIONS
<P></P>
<P>Interrupts and exceptions in general can be used as an attack vector as they allow non-secure code to gain control of the core at arbitrary times. Without additional protection this would expose the secure register state to modification, and facilitate reverse engineering of the secure code. In other systems (e.g. A-Profile systems) this risk has been mitigated by proxying exceptions destined for a non-secure domain through a secure domain, thus allowing the register state to be protected. This however adds considerable interrupt latency, which is unacceptable to many microcontroller customers. This section outlines various changes to the way exceptions are handled in order to protect the secure register state without significantly impacting interrupt latency.
