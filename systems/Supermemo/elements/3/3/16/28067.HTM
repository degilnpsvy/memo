6.1 Overview
<P></P>
<P>M-profile cores contain hardware to automatically stack/unstack the caller saved register state (as defined in the ARM procedural calling standard) around exceptions; this reduces interrupt latency and enables various additional optimisations like tail chaining. The general approach taken by the security extensions is to extend this mechanism to stack additional register state if it is detected that an exception will cause a transition from the secure to the non-secure state. As described in section 6.4 various events also cause the processor to clear the registers, this prevents secure data being visible to a non-secure exception handler.
