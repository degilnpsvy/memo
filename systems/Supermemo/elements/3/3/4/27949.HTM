A3.6.1 Privilege level access controls for data accesses</P>
<P>The memory attributes can define that a memory region is:<BR>&#8226; not accessible to any accesses<BR>&#8226; accessible only to Privileged accesses<BR>&#8226; accessible to Privileged and Unprivileged accesses.</P>
<P>The access privilege level is defined separately for explicit read and explicit write accesses. However, a system that defines the memory attributes is not required to support all combinations of memory attributes for read and write accesses.</P>
<P>A Privileged access is an access made during privileged execution, as a result of a load or store operation other than LDRT, STRT, LDRBT, STRBT, LDRHT, STRHT, LDRSHT, or LDRSBT.</P>
<P>An Unprivileged access is an access made as a result of load or store operation performed in one of these cases:<BR>&#8226; when the current execution mode is configured for Unprivileged access only<BR>&#8226; when the processor is in any mode and the access is made as a result of a LDRT, STRT, LDRBT, STRBT, LDRHT, STRHT, LDRSHT, or LDRSBT instruction.</P>
<P>An exception occurs if the processor attempts a data access that the access rights do not permit. For example, a MemManage exception occurs if the processor mode is Unprivileged and the processor attempts to access a memory region that is marked as only accessible to Privileged accesses.</P>
<P>Note<BR>Data access control is only supported when a Memory Protection Unit is implemented and enabled, see Protected Memory System Architecture, PMSAv7 on page B3-761.
