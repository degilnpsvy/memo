<P></P>
<P>[2] PRIVDEFENA<BR>When the ENABLE bit is set to 1, the meaning of this bit is:<BR>&nbsp; 0 = Disables the default memory map. Any instruction or data access that does not access a defined region<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>s.<BR>&nbsp; 1 = Enables the default memory map as a background region for privileged access. The background region acts as region number -1. All memory regions configured in the MPU take priority over the default memory map. The system address map on page B3-704 describes the default memory map.<BR>&nbsp; When the ENABLE bit is set to 0, the processor ignores the PRIVDEFENA bit.<BR>&nbsp; If no regions are enabled and the PRIVDEFENA and ENABLE bits are set to 1, only privileged code can execute from the system address map.
