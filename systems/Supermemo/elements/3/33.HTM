<SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Automating changes to the look of elements</SPAN></FONT></P>
<P>You do not need to change the look of elements over and over again. You do not need to create components again and again. It is enough you define a so-called template to be able to reuse a given component arrangement. The most important things to know about templates:</P>
<P>*you can save a given "look" with Template : Save as template </P>
<P>*if you want SuperMemo to automatically use a saved template when you choose Add new (Alt+A), use Template : Save as default </P>
<P>*if you want to reuse a previously saved template, use Template : Apply template (Shift+Ctrl+M). Remember that topics and items should have their separate templates as these affect their behavior and look during learning. For more information about templates see: Using templates ~
