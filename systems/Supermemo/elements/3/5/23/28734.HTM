<P>Print debugging information in addition to normal processing. Various levels and types of output can be chosen. With no arguments, print the &#8220;basic&#8221; level of debugging. Possible arguments are below; only the first character is considered, and values must be comma- or space-separated. 
<DL>
<DT><CODE>a (</CODE><I>all</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>All types of debugging output are enabled. This is equivalent to using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-d</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. <BR>
<DT><CODE>b (</CODE><I>basic</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>Basic debugging prints each target that was found to be out-of-date, and whether the build was successful or not. <BR>
<DT><CODE>v (</CODE><I>verbose</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>A level above &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>basic</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; includes messages about which makefiles were parsed, prerequisites that did not need to be rebuilt, etc. This option also enables &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>basic</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; messages. <BR>
<DT><CODE>i (</CODE><I>implicit</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>Prints messages describing the implicit rule searches for each target. This option also enables &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>basic</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; messages. <BR>
<DT><CODE>j (</CODE><I>jobs</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>Prints messages giving details on the invocation of specific sub-commands. <BR>
<DT><CODE>m (</CODE><I>makefile</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>By default, the above messages are not enabled while trying to remake the makefiles. This option enables messages while rebuilding makefiles, too. Note that the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>all</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option does enable this option. This option also enables &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>basic</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; messages. <BR>
<DT><CODE>n (</CODE><I>none</I><CODE>)</CODE> 
<DD>Disable all debugging currently enabled. If additional debugging flags are encountered after this they will still take effect. </DD></DL></DD>
