<P>Evaluate <VAR>string</VAR> as makefile syntax. This is a command-line version of the <CODE>eval</CODE> function (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Eval-Function">Eval Function</A>). The evaluation is performed after the default rules and variables have been defined, but before any makefiles are read. </P></DD>
