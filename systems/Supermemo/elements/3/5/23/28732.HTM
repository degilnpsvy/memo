GNU <CODE>make</CODE> proceeds to consider targets and their prerequisites using the normal algorithms; however, all targets so considered are always remade regardless of the status of their prerequisites. To avoid infinite recursion, if <CODE>MAKE_RESTARTS</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Special Variables</A>) is set to a number greater than 0 this option is disabled when considering whether to remake makefiles (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>). </DD>
