The <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> type attribute defines memory locations where an access to the location can cause side effects, or where the value returned for a load can vary depending on the number of loads performed. Examples of memory regions normally marked as being <SPAN class=cloze><FONT color=#000000>[...]</FONT></SPAN> are memory-mapped peripherals and I/O locations.
