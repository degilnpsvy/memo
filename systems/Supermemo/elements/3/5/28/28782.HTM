LDC, LDM, LDRD, POP, PUSH, STC, STRD, STM, VLDM, VPOP, VPUSH, VSTM, VLDR.64, and VSTR.64 instructions access a sequence of words at increasing memory addresses, effectively incrementing a memory address by 4 for each register load or store. If this calculation overflows the top of the address space, the result is <FONT class=clozed>UNPREDICTABLE</FONT>.
