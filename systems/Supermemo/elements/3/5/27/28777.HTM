<P><BR>If x and y are integers, Align(x,y) = <FONT class=clozed>y * (x DIV y)</FONT> is an integer.<BR>If x is a bitstring and y is an integer, Align(x,y) = <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.<BR>It is a pseudocode error to use either form of Align(x,y) in any context where y can be 0. In practice, Align(x,y) is only used with y a constant power of two, and the bitstring form used with y = 2^n has the effect of producing its argument with its n low-order bits forced to zero.
