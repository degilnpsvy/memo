&#8226; Information about which architecture variants include the particular encoding of the instruction. Thumb instructions present since ARMv4T are labelled as all versions of the Thumb instruction set, otherwise:<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; ARMv5T* means all variants of ARM Architecture version 5 that include Thumb instruction support.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; ARMv6-M means a Thumb-only variant of the ARM architecture microcontroller profile that is compatible with ARMv6 Thumb support prior to the introduction of Thumb-2 technology.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8213; ARMv7-M means a Thumb-only variant of the ARM architecture microcontroller profile that provides enhanced performance and functionality with respect to ARMv6-M through Thumb-2 technology and additional system features such as fault handling support.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; Note<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; This manual does not provide architecture variant information about non-M profile variants of ARMv6 and ARMv7. For such information, see the ARM Architecture Reference Manual, ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R edition.
