<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This document aims answering questions of those who program or want to program 32-bit x86 assembly using&nbsp;<I>free software</I>, particularly under the Linux operating system. At many places Universal Resource Locators (URL) are given for some software or documentation repository. This document also points to other documents about non-free, non-x86, or non-32-bit assemblers, although this is not its primary goal. Also note that there are FAQs and docs about programming on your favorite platform (whatever it is), which you should consult for platform-specific issues, not related directly to assembly programming.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Because the main interest of assembly programming is to build the guts of operating systems, interpreters, compilers, and games, where C compiler fails to provide the needed expressiveness (performance is more and more seldom as issue), we are focusing on development of such kind of software.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If you don't know what&nbsp;<I>free software</I>&nbsp;is, please do read&nbsp;<I>carefully</I>&nbsp;the GNU General Public License (GPL&nbsp;or&nbsp;copyleft), which is used in a lot of free software, and is the model for most of their licenses. It generally comes in a file named&nbsp;COPYING&nbsp;(or&nbsp;COPYING.LIB). Literature from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) might help you too. Particularly, the interesting feature of free software is that it comes with source code which you can consult and correct, or sometimes even borrow from. Read your particular license carefully and do comply to it.</SPAN>
