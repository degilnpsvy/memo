<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Short answer is -- noway. This is protected mode, use OS services instead. Again, you can't use&nbsp;int 0x10,&nbsp;int 0x13, etc. Fortunately almost everything can be implemented by means of system calls or library functions. In the worst case you may go through direct port access, or make a kernel patch to implement needed functionality, or use LRMI library to access BIOS functions.</SPAN>
