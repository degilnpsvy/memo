<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">CPP is truly not very expressive, but it's enough for easy things, it's standard, and called transparently by GCC.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As an example of its limitations, you can't declare objects so that destructors are automatically called at the end of the declaring block; you don't have diversions or scoping, etc.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">CPP comes with any C compiler. However, considering how mediocre it is, stay away from it if by chance you can make it without C.</SPAN>
