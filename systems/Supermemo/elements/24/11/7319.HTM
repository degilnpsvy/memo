<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As you've read before, you can write for Linux in different ways; I'll show how to use&nbsp;<I>direct</I>&nbsp;kernel calls, since this is the fastest way to call kernel service; our code is not linked to any library, does not use ELF interpreter, it communicates with kernel directly.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I will show the same sample program in two assemblers,&nbsp;<B>nasm</B>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<B>gas</B>, thus showing Intel and AT&amp;T syntax.</SPAN></P>
