Read their docs about that, but often, they just simulate&nbsp;int 0x21&nbsp;and such, so you do "as if" you are in real mode (I doubt they have more than stubs and extend things to work with 32-bit operands; they most likely will just reflect the interrupt into the real-mode or vm86 handler).</SPAN></P>

The thing you should know is that there is the cygwin32.dll library, for GNU programs to run on Win32 platform; thus, you can use GCC, GAS, all the GNU tools, and many other Unix applications.</SPAN>
