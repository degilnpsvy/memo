<P>For each buffer, you can answer <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> to save it or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>n</SPAN> not to. You can also type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>!</SPAN> to save all the buffers without asking. If you want to save this buffer and no more, type a period (.). If you want to cancel the command and not save the current buffer, press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>q</SPAN> (of course, any buffers you saved before pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>q</SPAN> are already saved; <SPAN class=docEmphBold>q</SPAN> does not undo those). You may want to look at the buffer before deciding whether to save it; if so, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-r</SPAN>. Emacs enters view mode, allowing you to look at the buffer but not make changes. Press <SPAN class=docEmphBold>q</SPAN> to exit view mode and continue saving buffers.
