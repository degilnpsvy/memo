Thus, during a typical git push command, the source branches from your repository are sent to the remote repository using a refspec such as: </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>This refspec can be paraphrased as follows: From the local repository, take each branch name found under the source namespace refs/heads/ and place it in a similarly named, matching branch under the destination namespace refs/heads/ in the remote repository.
