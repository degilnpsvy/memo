Originally, <FONT class=extract>the git cherry-pick command selected and reapplied one commit at a time.</FONT> However, in later versions of Git, git cherry-pick allowed a range of commits to be selected and reapplied in a single command. For example, the following command: 
<P></P>
<P># on branch master </P>
<P><FONT class=clozed></FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>$ git cherry-pick X..Z</FONT></P>
<P>would apply new commits X', Y', and Z' on the master branch. This is particularly handy in porting or moving a large sequence of commits from one line of development to another without necessarily using the entire source branch at one time.
