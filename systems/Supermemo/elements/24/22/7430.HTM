The remote repository may have branches deleted from it by the actions of other developers, even though your copies of those branches may linger in your repository. The <FONT class=clozed>git remote prune </FONT>command may be used to remove the names of those stale (with respect to the actual remote repository) remote-tracking branches from your local repository.
