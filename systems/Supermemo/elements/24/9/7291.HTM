<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">osimpa is an assembler for Intel 80386 processors and subsequent, written entirely in the GNU Bash command interpreter shell. The predecessor of osimpa was shasm. osimpa is much cleaned up, can create useful Linux ELF executables, and has various HLL-like extensions and programmer convenience commands.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It is (of course) slower than other assemblers. It has its own syntax (and uses its own names for x86 opcodes) Fairly good documentation is included. Check it out: ftp://linux01.gwdg.de/pub/cLIeNUX/interim/ (Access is password controlled). You will probably not use it on regular basis, but at least it deserves your interest as an interesting idea.</SPAN>
