<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Win32Forth is a&nbsp;<I>free</I>&nbsp;32-bit ANS FORTH system that successfully runs under Win32s, Win95, Win/NT. It includes a free 32-bit assembler (either prefix or postfix syntax) integrated into the reflective FORTH language. Macro processing is done with the full power of the reflective language FORTH; however, the only supported input and output contexts is Win32For itself (no dumping of&nbsp;.obj&nbsp;file, but you could add that feature yourself, of course).
