<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">HLA is a&nbsp;<I>H</I>igh&nbsp;<I>L</I>evel&nbsp;<I>A</I>ssembly language. It uses a high level language like syntax (similar to Pascal, C/C++, and other HLLs) for variable declarations, procedure declarations, and procedure calls. It uses a modified assembly language syntax for the standard machine instructions. It also provides several high level language style control structures (if, while, repeat..until, etc.) that help you write much more readable code.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">HLA is free and comes with source, Linux and Win32 versions available. On Win32 you need MASM and a 32-bit version of MS-link on Win32, on Linux you need GAS, because HLA produces specified assembler code and uses that assembler for final assembling and linking.</SPAN>
