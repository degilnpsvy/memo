<FONT class=extract>There is a one-to-one correspondence between a set of changes in the repository and a commit</FONT>: A commit is the only method of introducing changes to a repository, and any change in the repository must be introduced by a commit. This mandate provides accountability. Under no circumstance should repository data change without a record of the change!
