<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Good news are that starting from binutils 2.10 release, GAS supports Intel syntax too. It can be triggered with&nbsp;.intel_syntax&nbsp;directive. Unfortunately this mode is not documented (yet?) in the official binutils manual, so if you want to use it, try to examine http://www.lxhp.in-berlin.de/lhpas86.html, which is an extract from AMD 64bit port of binutils 2.11.</SPAN>
