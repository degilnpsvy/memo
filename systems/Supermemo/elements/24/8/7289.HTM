<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">YASM is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the "new" BSD License. It is designed from the ground up to allow for multiple syntaxes to be supported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object formats including COFF, Win32 and Mach-O. Another primary module of the overall design is an optimizer module.</SPAN>
