<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">GAS has some macro capability included, as detailed in the texinfo docs. Moreover, while GCC recognizes&nbsp;.s&nbsp;files as raw assembly to send to GAS, it also recognizes&nbsp;.S&nbsp;files as files to pipe through CPP before feeding them to GAS. Again and again, see Linux sources for examples.</SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">GAS also has GASP (GAS Preprocessor), which adds all the usual macroassembly tricks to GAS. GASP comes together with GAS in the GNU binutils archive. It works as a filter, like and . I have no idea on details, but it comes with its own texinfo documentation, which you would like to browse (<B>info gasp</B>), print, grok. GAS with GASP looks like a regular macro-assembler to me.</SPAN>
