<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">FASM (flat assembler) is a fast, efficient 80x86 assembler that runs in 'flat real mode'. Unlike many other 80x86 assemblers, FASM only requires the source code to include the information it really needs. It is written in itself and is very small and fast. It runs on DOS/Windows/Linux and can produce flat binary, DOS EXE, Win32 PE, COFF and Linux ELF output. See http://flatassembler.net.</SPAN>
