<H1 class=SECT1><A name=WHY-WRITE-INSECURE>2.3. Why do Programmers Write Insecure Code?</A></H1>
<P>Many programmers don't intend to write insecure code - but do anyway. Here are a number of purported reasons for this. Most of these were collected and summarized by Aleph One on Bugtraq (in a posting on December 17, 1998):</P>

<UL>
<LI>
<P>There is no curriculum that addresses computer security in most schools. Even when there<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>is</EM><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>a computer security curriculum, they often don't discuss how to write secure programs as a whole. Many such curriculum only study certain areas such as cryptography or protocols. These are important, but they often fail to discuss common real-world issues such as buffer overflows, string formatting, and input checking. I believe this is one of the most important problems; even those programmers who go through colleges and universities are very unlikely to learn how to write secure programs, yet we depend on those very people to write secure programs.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Programming books/classes do not teach secure/safe programming techniques. Indeed, until recently there were no books on how to write secure programs at all (this book is one of those few).</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>No one uses formal verification methods.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>C is an unsafe language, and the standard C library string functions are unsafe. This is particularly important because C is so widely used - the ``simple'' ways of using C permit dangerous exploits.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Programmers do not think ``multi-user.''</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Programmers are human, and humans are lazy. Thus, programmers will often use the ``easy'' approach instead of a secure approach - and once it works, they often fail to fix it later.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Most programmers are simply not good programmers.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Most programmers are not security people; they simply don't often think like an attacker does.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Most security people are not programmers. This was a statement made by some Bugtraq contributors, but it's not clear that this claim is really true.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Most computer security models are terrible.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>There is lots of ``broken'' legacy software. Fixing this software (to remove security faults or to make it work with more restrictive security policies) is difficult.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Consumers don't care about security. (Personally, I have hope that consumers are beginning to care about security; a computer system that is constantly exploited is neither useful nor user-friendly. Also, many consumers are unaware that there's even a problem, assume that it can't happen to them, or think that that things cannot be made better.)</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Security costs extra development time.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Security costs in terms of additional testing (red teams, etc.).</P></LI></UL>
