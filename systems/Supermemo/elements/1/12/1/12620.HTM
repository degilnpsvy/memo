<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Now we will add a library to our project. This library will contain our own implementation for computing the square root of a number. The executable can then use this library instead of the standard square root function provided by the compiler. For this tutorial we will put the library into a subdirectory called MathFunctions. It will have the following one line CMakeLists file:</SPAN> </P>

To make use of the new library we add an add_subdirectory call in the top level CMakeLists file so that the library will get built. We also add another include directory so that the MathFunctions/mysqrt.h header file can be found for the function prototype. The last change is to add the new library to the executable. The last few lines of the top level CMakeLists file now look like:</SPAN></P>
