In Emacs, to sort lines by a specific column, use <FONT class=clozed>sort-fields or sort-numeric-fields. </FONT>
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>(&#8220;fields&#8221; are separated by space or tabs. First field is 1, not 0.) For example: Type &#12304;Ctrl+u&#12305;, then 2, then &#12304;Alt+x sort-field&#12305;. This will sort the line by the 2nd column, and the fields are compared as strings.</FONT>
