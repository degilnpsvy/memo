<P>It is the programmer's responsibility to perform alpha-testing, which should detect and eliminate most program errors. Alpha testing requires a fair amount of thought and time, so it is imperative that programs be in a working state well before the due date. This will give you time to think of potential problems and make adjustments before turning it in.</P>
<P>This includes anticipating and handling all kinds of incorrect input from the user. The program should, whenever possible, produce an error message telling the user exactly what the problem was and how to correct the input, and then allow the user to try again. If retrying input is not feasible, the program should exit gracefully (not crash).</P>
<P>Programs should not over-react to error conditions. They should continue to run and and produce as much useful output as possible, unless there is a good reason to terminate.</P>
<P>Beta-testing is performed by typical users, and should generally detect only usability issues. Beta testers should never experience a program crash or incorrect output. Beta quality software has been worked over by the developers to the point where they cannot find any more bugs, and believe that it is ready for release for official use. Programs written for this class should be beta quality before being turned in for grading.</P>
<P>Error status should be passed up through the layers to the appropriate level. For example, general purpose subprograms such as read_num, read_list, factorial, etc. should never print error messages or take any other action on their own. Doing so makes them unusable in other programs unless they are modified, in which case they must be re-tested. They should report the error back to the caller via a return value or argument. The caller may or may not be the proper place to handle the error either. ( e.g. if read_list gets an error code back from read_num, it should be passed up another level to the caller of read_list. )</P>
<P>Every subprogram should validate the arguments received and return a status code indicating bad data. For example, a function computing the factorial or argument n should return an error status (e.g. -1, which is not the factorial of anything) if it cannot compute the factorial of the given number (i.e. n is negative, or n! Is beyond the range of the return type).</P></DIV>
