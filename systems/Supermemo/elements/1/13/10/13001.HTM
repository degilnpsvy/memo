<P><SPAN class=textbf style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Martin Odersky</SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>is the creator of the Scala language. As a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland, he works on programming languages, more specifically languages for object-oriented and functional programming. His research thesis is that the two paradigms are two sides of the same coin, to be unified as much as possible. To prove this, he has experimented with a number of language designs, from Pizza to GJ to Functional Nets. He has also influenced the development of Java as a co-designer of Java generics and as the original author of the current<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class=code>javac</SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>reference compiler. Since 2001 he has concentrated on designing, implementing, and refining the Scala programming language.</P>
<P><SPAN class=textbf style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Lex Spoon</SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>is a software engineer at Google, Inc. He worked on Scala for two years as a post-doc at EPFL. He has a Ph.D. in computer science from Georgia Tech, where he worked on static analysis of dynamic languages. In addition to Scala, he has worked on a wide variety of programming languages, ranging from the dynamic language Smalltalk to the scientific language X10. He and his wife currently live in Atlanta with two cats, a chihuahua, and a turtle.</P>
<P><SPAN class=textbf style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Bill Venners</SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>is president of Artima, Inc., publisher of the Artima Developer website (www.artima.com). He is author of the book,<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Inside the Java Virtual Machine</EM>, a programmer-oriented survey of the Java platform's architecture and internals. His popular columns in JavaWorld magazine covered Java internals, object-oriented design, and Jini. Active in the Jini Community since its inception, Bill led the Jini Community's ServiceUI project, whose ServiceUI API became the de facto standard way to associate user interfaces to Jini services. Bill is also the lead developer and designer of ScalaTest, an open source testing tool for Scala and Java developers.</P></DIV><BR class=Apple-interchange-newline>
