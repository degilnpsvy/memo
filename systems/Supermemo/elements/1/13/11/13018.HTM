<P>You've probably been told since you were a baby that that you're fabulous. It's true. It's nice to be fabulous, but in the job market, it's mostly irrelevant. Unless you're a game show host, nobody is going to pay you a high salary for being fabulous. Most of us have to be useful.</P>
<P>What do you plan to do for a career after college? What will you have to offer potential employers? You should have a pretty good idea about this before declaring a major. If you don't, then you will have little chance of being prepared for the workplace by the time you graduate.</P>
<P>Employers are ultimately interested in only a few questions:</P>
<DIV class=orderedlist>
<OL class=orderedlist type=1>
<LI class=listitem>Do you get things done?</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Are you likely to stay with the company?</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Are you sociable enough to get along with your co-workers?</LI></OL></DIV>
<P>Employers don't care why you can't do something. They simply need someone who can. If you had a bad teacher, they'll find someone who either had a better teacher, or found a way to develop their skills anyway. If you're having problems that aren't your fault, but interfere with your ability to get work done, they'll offer you sympathy, and offer someone else the job.</P>
<P>The laws of economics are like the laws of physics: They cannot be violated. Every company has to bring in more money than it spends in order to stay in business. An employee who produces less than they're paid cannot be kept around for long.</P></DIV></DIV>
