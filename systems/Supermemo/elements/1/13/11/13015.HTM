<P>What character traits and habits lead to success?</P>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.1.&nbsp;Determination/Tenacity>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952106></A>1.3.1.&nbsp;Determination/Tenacity</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Raw talent has little to do with ultimate success, and in many cases can be detrimental. Those who struggle to succeed gain more than those who have an easy time of it. Life will eventually present major challenges for all of us. Those of us who have struggled and succeeded before will be better prepared to handle them.</P>
<P>If you're determined to succeed and grow, nothing will prevent it from happening. Incompetent teachers and co-workers, illness, and financial problems may slow you down, but they won't keep you from accomplishing something if you really want it.</P>
<P>If you don't really want something, that's OK too. Realize that if you fail at something, it can only mean one thing: You didn't want it enough to do what was necessary to succeed. There's nothing wrong with not wanting to succeed at something. The important thing is to be honest with yourself about what you really want. If you realize that you've been headed down the wrong path, you have nothing to regret. It's all part of getting to know yourself, and every step you take, regardless of where it leads you, is a valuable learning experience.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.2.&nbsp;Focus>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952122></A>1.3.2.&nbsp;Focus</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Excerpt from the "Engineer Identification Test":</P>
<DIV class=blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE class=blockquote>If there is one trait that best defines an engineer it is the ability to concentrate on one subject to the complete exclusion of everything else in the environment. This sometimes causes engineers to be pronounced dead prematurely. Some funeral homes in high-tech areas have started checking resumes before processing the bodies. Anybody with a degree in electrical engineering or experience in computer programming is propped up in the lounge for a few days just to see if he or she snaps out of it.</BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
<P>If you're going to succeed at anything, it must have your full attention. If it is not your top priority long enough to get it done, then you won't get good results.</P>
<P>The world is full of the results of half-hearted efforts. Most of us complain about them countless times per day. They include little things like shipping delays, the car that keeps breaking down, the potato chip bag you can't possibly open without tearing to pieces. They also include more important things like car accidents caused by people texting while driving and serious complications from mistakes in surgery.</P>
<P>All these problems are created by people who aren't fully committed to the task at hand. All of these problems could be easily prevented if those doing the work were giving it their full attention.</P>
<P>Develop a habit of focusing on one thing at a time. You may find that turning off the TV and the stereo while you work leads to better productivity and less fatigue and stress. Make yourself a list of things that need to be done, so that you're not distracted by the need to remember them all. A dull pencil often works better than a sharp mind.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.3.&nbsp;Decisiveness>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952149></A>1.3.3.&nbsp;Decisiveness</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Separate decisions from actions. Whether making lunch, driving a car, or writing a program, clear decisions lead to effective action. Trying to figure out what you're doing as you do it usually just makes a mess.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.4.&nbsp;Efficiency>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952158></A>1.3.4.&nbsp;Efficiency</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Once you've decided that you're committed to the task, it's time to think about how to best go about it. Blindly throwing time at an endeavor without thinking is unlikely to produce success.</P>
<P>It's very important to invest some time at the beginning of a pursuit into developing a systematic approach to it. Random, unplanned action will not produce good results. Develop an efficient system for studying, for programming, for getting to school, for making pizza, etc. Always think before taking the next step, and reflect on past steps to see how they could have been taken more effectively.</P>
<P>Develop a mind-set of always making the most of the time you put into something. Most of us are shrewd about getting the most for our money. Doesn't it make sense to get the most for our time as well? In the west, we have the saying "Time is money." In the east, time is valued a bit more: "Time is God's money." Each of us is given a one-time fixed allowance. How will you spend yours?</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.5.&nbsp;Independence>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952174></A>1.3.5.&nbsp;Independence</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Many students enter college with the expectation of being fed the knowledge that they will need to succeed in a particular field. This expectation is unrealistic. The knowledge you will need to make it in your career is far more vast than could possibly be covered in college lectures that meet only a few hours per week.</P>
<P>If you memorize everything you're taught in college, you'll know a tiny fraction of what you need to succeed in the workplace.</P>
<P>What you really need to develop is the ability to teach yourself and apply the knowledge you have. The most successful people aren't those who know the most, but those who know how to figure things out. The ability to find answers quickly and know what to do with them is almost as good as infinite knowledge.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.6.&nbsp;Teamwork>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952190></A>1.3.6.&nbsp;Teamwork</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Is teamwork the opposite of independence?</P>
<P>The ability to work independently makes you a good team member. In addition to independence, though, a team requires good communication, and egos under control. Each team member has a different job, which may not always be the job they want. Team members must be able to understand and accept their role and work independently to fulfill it.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.7.&nbsp;Doing>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952203></A>1.3.7.&nbsp;Doing</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Understanding comes from doing, not from observing.</P><PRE class=screen>	    "I hear and I forget.  I see and I remember.  I do and I
	    understand."
	    
						-Chinese proverb
	    </PRE>
<P>Very little understanding is gained even in the best of classrooms. Teachers can only point the way; they cannot make you understand.</P>
<P>Watching your teacher write code won't make you a great programmer any more than watching Dan Jansen will make you a great speed skater. To become good at anything, you have to invest long hours of practice, but even that in itself is not enough. You also have to use that time effectively. Practicing bad habits will make it even harder to progress, so be sure to study the procedures and techniques carefully before you practice them!</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.8.&nbsp;Balance>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952225></A>1.3.8.&nbsp;Balance</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Hard work, friends and family, and time for yourself should all be priorities in your life. To be successful in all of these areas, you must allocate sufficient time and attention to each one of them.</P>
<P>Most people lose sight of this and end up spending a disproportionate part of their lives chasing after money or achievements as if they're the ultimate goal. Financial success isn't worth much if you're not happy.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title=1.3.9.&nbsp;Ego>
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952237></A>1.3.9.&nbsp;Ego</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Excerpt from the "Engineer Identification Test":</P>
<DIV class=blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE class=blockquote>
<P>Ego-wise, two things are important to engineers:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist type=disc>
<LI class=listitem>How smart they are.</LI>
<LI class=listitem>How many cool devices they have.</LI></UL></DIV>
<P>The fastest way to get an engineer to solve a problem is to declare that the problem is unsolvable. No engineer can walk away from an unsolvable problem until it's solved. No illness or distraction is sufficient to get the engineer off the case. These types of challenges quickly become personal -- a battle between the engineer and the laws of nature.</P>
<P>Engineers will go without food and hygiene for days to solve a problem. (Other times just because they forgot.) And when they succeed in solving the problem they will experience an ego rush that is better than sex.</P>
<P>Nothing is more threatening to the engineer than the suggestion that somebody has more technical skill. Normal people sometimes use that knowledge as a lever to extract more work from the engineer. When an engineer says that something can't be done (a code phrase that means it's not fun to do), some clever normal people have learned to glance at the engineer with a look of compassion and pity and say something along these lines: "I'll ask Bob to figure it out. He knows how to solve difficult technical problems."</P>
<P>At that point it is a good idea for the normal person to not stand between the engineer and the problem. The engineer will set upon the problem like a starved Chihuahua on a pork chop.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
<P>Life will eventually reign in your ego. This can be a painful process if your ego is the boss when the time comes. Better to subdue it on your own time before that day arrives.</P>
<DIV class=section title="Gauging your Ego">
<DIV class=titlepage>

<DIV>
<H4 class=title><A name=id286952279></A>Gauging your Ego</H4></DIV></DIV></DIV>

<LI class=listitem>Does criticism upset you?</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Do you fear failure? Are you afraid to try things because you don't think you'll succeed?</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Do you need praise to stay motivated?</LI></UL></DIV>
<P>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, you have some work to do on your ego.</P></DIV>
<P>Focus your efforts on the things that really matter, and let everything else go.</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title="1.3.10.&nbsp;Understanding Cause and Effect">
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952306></A>1.3.10.&nbsp;Understanding Cause and Effect</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Every action has its consequences. Where you are today is largely due to choices you made before. Where you will be tomorrow and beyond depends on the choices you make today.</P>
<P>You will be best at the things you practice most. What will these things be?</P></DIV>
<DIV class=section title="1.3.11.&nbsp;Personal Responsibility">
<DIV class=titlepage>
<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952318></A>1.3.11.&nbsp;Personal Responsibility</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Responsibility and blame are not synonymous. Blame is a useless concept whose sole purpose is to protect the ego. It relates to the problem, not the solution. Responsibility is about taking action to solve problems, not about feeling good or bad, valuable or worthless.</P>
<P>The Ojibwe (Chippewa) language has no word for<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class=quote>&#8220;<SPAN class=quote>sorry</SPAN>&#8221;</SPAN>. In Ojibwe culture, someone who causes harm is simply expected to requit it without delay, and without without feeling bad about it. The issue is then considered resolved, and all parties are expected to leave it in the past.</P>
<P>Accept responsibility for your own success or failure. You have very little control over the world around you, what other people do, or who they are. You have a great deal of control over how you respond to each situation you find yourself in. Take advantage of the choices you have rather than lament things that are beyond your control.</P></DIV>

<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952338></A>1.3.12.&nbsp;Communicate with Precision</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Sloppy communication with family and friends often leads to misunderstandings, arguments, and severed relationships.</P>
<P>Sloppy communication in engineering often leads to misunderstandings, mechanical failure, injury, and death.</P>
<P>As an engineer, you need to develop a habit of thinking carefully about everything you say and do. This can be difficult at first, but quickly becomes habit if you're committed to the practice. Colleagues in the field<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class=emphasis><EM>must</EM></SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>be able to assume that you mean what you say. Hence, it is imperative that you always say what you mean.</P></DIV>

<DIV>
<DIV>
<H3 class=title><A name=id286952497></A>1.3.13.&nbsp;Verify</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Excerpt from the "Engineer Identification Test":</P>
<DIV class=blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE class=blockquote>
<P>The risk/reward calculation for engineers looks something like this:</P>
<P>RISK: Public humiliation and the death of thousands of innocent people.</P>
<P>REWARD: A certificate of appreciation in a handsome plastic frame.</P>
<P>Being practical people, engineers evaluate this balance of risks and rewards and decide that risk is not a good thing. The best way to avoid risk is by advising that any activity is technically impossible for reasons that are far too complicated to explain.</P>
<P>If that approach is not sufficient to halt the project, then the engineer will fall back to a second line of defense: "It's technically possible but it will cost too much."</P></BLOCKQUOTE></DIV>
<P>Assumptions are one of the most common causes of major catastrophes. The $125 million Mars probe lost in Sep, 1999 was a victim of assumptions made by both Lockheed Martin and NASA that they were using the same units of measurement. NASA in fact used metric, while Lockheed Martin used the English system. This was not a case of<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class=emphasis><EM>bad</EM></SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>communication. It was a case of<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN class=emphasis><EM>no</EM></SPAN><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>communication, because neither party thought to verify some basic facts about the project.</P>
<P>As engineers, we must take time to list all of the assumptions we make, no matter how obvious they may seem, and verify each and every one of them.</P></DIV>

<P>It has been shown that long stretches of flat text are one of the least effective forms of documentation.</P>
<P>They are also the most common, and often the only source available. To be successful, you have to develop strong reading skills. This means learning to read quickly, recognize the relevant material, find other sources to clarify parts that you have trouble understanding, and to retain what you have read.</P>
<P>These skills only come with practice. You will likely need to read thousands of pages of documentation per year in most professions. Start practicing while you're in college by reading your course notes and textbooks cover-to-cover. This will make the transition to the workplace much easier. You can enhance your reading skills on anything: Novels, comic books, technical manuals, The Onion, etc. Any reading will improve your skills and make reading technical documents more productive.</P></DIV>

<H3 class=title><A name=id286952556></A>1.3.15.&nbsp;Go Well Beyond Requirements</H3></DIV></DIV></DIV>
<P>Write a lot of code before you graduate. Students who do only what's required for class assignments are demonstrating a lack of interest in their chosen field, and in education in general. Good employers will quickly discard resumes that don't show enough initiative to explore beyond the demands of school.</P>
<P>Aim to complete projects long before deadlines. This way, if you fail to meet your own goal, you might still make the deadline. If you meet your goal, you'll have time to truly relax, since your work will be done and out of mind.</P>
<P>There are several things that every computer science student can do while in school to be better prepared for a career:</P>
<DIV class=itemizedlist>
<UL class=itemizedlist type=disc>
<LI class=listitem>Do a long-term personal project of at least several thousand lines of code. The application and language used are a personal choice, and demonstrate to employers where your interests lie. This project will provide the experience of writing a sizeable program over a long period of time, which can't be done as a class assignment.</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Use programming to solve problems in other classes. There are many opportunities to apply programming in virtually any non-cs class you take. Be creative.</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Experiment with installing and configuring other operating systems. This will enhance your understanding of OS capabilities and develop highly valuable work skills. PC owners have a wide variety of FREE choices these days. There are dozens of high-quality BSD and Linux distributions. Many can be installed and run under a free virtual machine such as VirtualBox, so you don't even need another computer. The Internet runs primarily on open source Unix-like systems such as FreeBSD and Linux. Learning these systems is a valuable work skill in itself. There are jobs involving WEB development and systems management in virtually every major city on the map.</LI>
<LI class=listitem>Build a computer from scratch. In today's world, you can get most parts for free or almost free (on the curb, on the WEB, etc.).</LI></UL></DIV></DIV></DIV>
