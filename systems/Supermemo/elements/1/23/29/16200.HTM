predicate
<P></P>
<P><FONT size=5>For example, in the code segment in the preceding section, the predicate associated with cond is (avail == 0). This code segment demonstrates a general design principle: a pthread_cond_wait() call must be governed by a while loop rather than an if statement. This is so because, on return from pthread_cond_wait(), there are no guarantees about the state of the predicate; therefore, we should immediately recheck the predicate and resume sleeping if it is not in the desired state.</FONT>
