Modify the program in Listing 30-1 (thread_incr.c) so that each loop in the thread&#8217;s start function outputs the current value of glob and some identifier that uniquely identifies the thread. The unique identifier for the thread could be specified as an argument to the pthread_create() call used to create the thread. For this program, that would require changing the argument of the thread&#8217;s start function to be a pointer to a structure containing the unique identifier and a loop limit value. Run the program, redirecting output to a file, and then inspect the file to see what happens to glob as the kernel scheduler alternates execution between the two threads. </SPAN>
