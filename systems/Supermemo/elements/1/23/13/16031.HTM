<P style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt" class=MsoNormal><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 15.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt" lang=EN-US>Each condition variable has an associated <FONT class=clozed>predicate</FONT> involving one or more shared variables. For example, in the code segment in the preceding section, the predicate associated with cond is (avail == 0). This code segment demonstrates a general design principle: a pthread_cond_wait() call must be governed by a while loop rather than an if statement. This is so because, on return from pthread_cond_wait(), there are no guarantees about the state of the predicate; therefore, we should immediately recheck the predicate and resume sleeping if it is not in the desired state.</SPAN>
