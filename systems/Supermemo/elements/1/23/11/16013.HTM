If any of the pthread_mutex_trylock() calls fails (with EBUSY), then the thread releases all mutexes, and then tries again, perhaps after a delay interval. This approach is less efficient than a lock hierarchy, since multiple iterations may be required. On the other hand, it can be more flexible, since it doesn&#8217;t require a rigid mutex hierarchy. An example of this strategy is shown in [Butenhof, 1996].</FONT></SPAN>
