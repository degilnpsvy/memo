When threads can lock the same set of mutexes, they should always lock them in the same order. For example, in the scenario in Figure 30-3, the deadlock could be avoided if the two threads always lock the mutexes in the order mutex1 followed by mutex2. Sometimes, there is a logically obvious hierarchy of mutexes. However, even if there isn&#8217;t, it may be possible to devise an arbitrary hierarchical order that all threads should follow.</SPAN>
