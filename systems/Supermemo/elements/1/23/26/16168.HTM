futexes (an acronym derived from fast user space mutexes), and lock contentions are dealt with using the futex() system call. We don&#8217;t describe futexes in this book (they are not intended for direct use in user-space applications), but details can be found in [Drepper, 2004 (a)], which also describes how mutexes are implemented using futexes. [Franke et al., 2002] is a (now outdated) paper written by the developers of futexes, which describes the early futex implementation and looks at the performance gains derived from futexes.
