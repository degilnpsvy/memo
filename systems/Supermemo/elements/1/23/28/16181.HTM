The reason for this is that PTHREAD_CANCELED, the value returned when a thread is canceled (see Chapter 32), is usually some implementation defined integer value cast to void *. If a thread&#8217;s start function returns the same integer value, then, to another thread that is doing a pthread_join(), it will wrongly appear that the thread was canceled. In an application that employs thread cancellation and chooses to return cast integer values from a thread&#8217;s start functions, we must ensure that a normally terminating thread does not return an integer whose value matches PTHREAD_CANCELED on that Pthreads implementation. A portable application would need to ensure that normally terminating threads don&#8217;t return integer values that match PTHREAD_CANCELED on any of the implementations on which the application is to run.</EM></SPAN>
