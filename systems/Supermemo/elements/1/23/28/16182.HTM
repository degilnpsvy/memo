The POSIX.2 standard (<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE>) which specifies <CODE>make</CODE> does not require any of these features.</P>

<LI>A target of the form &#8216;<SAMP><VAR>file</VAR><SPAN class=samp>((</SPAN><VAR>entry</VAR><SPAN class=samp>))</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; stands for a member of archive file <VAR>file</VAR>. The member is chosen, not by name, but by being an object file which defines the linker symbol <VAR>entry</VAR>. 
<P>This feature was not put into GNU <CODE>make</CODE> because of the non-modularity of putting knowledge into <CODE>make</CODE> of the internal format of archive file symbol tables. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archive-Symbols">Updating Archive Symbol Directories</A>. </P></LI>
