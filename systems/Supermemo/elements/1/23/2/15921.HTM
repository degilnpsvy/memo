Threaded applications must employ synchronization primitives such as mutexes and condition variables in order to coordinate access to shared variables. A mutex provides exclusive access to a shared variable. A condition variable allows one or more threads to wait for notification that some other thread has changed the state of a shared variable.</SPAN>
