given a suitable pointer, it is possible for threads to share data on each other&#8217;s stacks. This is occasionally useful, but it requires careful programming to handle the dependency that results from the fact that a local variable remains valid only for the lifetime of the stack frame in which it resides. (If a function returns, the memory region used by its stack frame may be reused by a later function call. If the thread terminates, a new thread may reuse the memory region used for the terminated thread&#8217;s stack.) Failing to correctly handle this dependency can create bugs that are hard to track down.
