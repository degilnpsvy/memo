POSIX thread IDs are assigned and maintained by the threading implementation. The thread ID returned by gettid() is a number (similar to a process ID) that is assigned by the kernel. Although each POSIX thread has a unique kernel thread ID in the Linux NPTL threading implementation, an application generally doesn&#8217;t need to know about the kernel IDs (and won&#8217;t be portable if it depends on knowing them).</EM></SPAN>
