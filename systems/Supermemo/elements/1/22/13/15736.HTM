&#8220;No-op&#8221;. Causes <CODE>make</CODE> to print the recipes that are needed to make the targets up to date, but not actually execute them. Note that some recipes are still executed, even with this flag (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKE-Variable">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A>). Also any recipes needed to update included makefiles are still executed (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>).
