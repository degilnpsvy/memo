On the other hand, prefix characters on the recipe line that refers to a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence. So the rule: <PRE class=example>     frob.out: frob.in

</PRE>
<P class=noindent>does not echo <EM>any</EM> recipe lines. (See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Echoing">Recipe Echoing</A>, for a full explanation of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;.)
