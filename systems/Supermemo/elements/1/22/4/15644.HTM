With the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag, <CODE>make</CODE> <FONT class=clozed>ignores the recipes in the rules and uses (in effect) the command <CODE>touch</CODE> for each target that needs to be remade. The <CODE>touch</CODE> command is also printed, unless &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-s</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> is used. For speed, <CODE>make</CODE> does not actually invoke the program <CODE>touch</CODE>. It does the work directly.</FONT>
