Mutexes allow threads to synchronize their use of a shared resource, so that, for example, one thread doesn&#8217;t try to access a shared variable at the same time as another thread is modifying it. <FONT class=extract>Condition variables perform a complementary task: they allow threads to inform each other that a shared variable (or other shared resource) has changed state.</FONT></SPAN>
