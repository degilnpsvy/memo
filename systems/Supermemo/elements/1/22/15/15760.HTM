When you run <CODE>make</CODE> with the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> flag, errors are ignored in all recipes of all rules. A rule in the makefile for the special target <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> has the same effect, if there are no prerequisites. These ways of ignoring errors are obsolete because &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is more flexible.
