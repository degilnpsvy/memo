All the source branches from a remote repository in namespace refs/heads/ are (i) mapped into your local repository using a name constructed from the remote name and (ii) placed under the refs/remotes/remote namespace. 
<P></P>
<P>Because of the asterisks, this refspec applies to multiple branches as found in the remote&#8217;s refs/heads/*. It is exactly this specification that causes the remote&#8217;s topic branches to be mapped into your repository&#8217;s namespace as remote-tracking branches and separates them into subnames based on the remote name.</P>
<P>Although not mandatory, it is convention and common best practice to place the branches for a given remote under refs/remotes/remote/*.
