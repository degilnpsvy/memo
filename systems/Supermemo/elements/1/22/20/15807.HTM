target pattern. 
<P></P>
<P>For example, numerous rules make &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; files: one, from a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.c</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; file with the C compiler; another, from a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.p</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; file with the Pascal compiler; and so on. The rule that actually applies is the one whose prerequisites exist or can be made. So, if you have a file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> will run the C compiler; otherwise, if you have a file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p</SPAN></SAMP>, <CODE>make</CODE> will run the Pascal compiler; and so on.
