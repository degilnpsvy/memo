Note that only the line containing the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character or the strings &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(MAKE)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>${MAKE}</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is run regardless of these options. Other lines in the same rule are not run unless they too begin with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or contain &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(MAKE)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>${MAKE}</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKE-Variable">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A>.)
