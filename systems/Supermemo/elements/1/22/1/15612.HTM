When a prerequisite's name has the form &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;, <CODE>make</CODE> handles it specially by searching for <FONT class=clozed>the file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR><SPAN class=file>.so</SPAN></SAMP>, and, if it is not found, for the file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR><SPAN class=file>.a</SPAN></SAMP> in the current directory, in directories specified by matching <CODE>vpath</CODE> search paths and the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> search path, and then in the directories <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/lib</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/usr/lib</SPAN></SAMP>, and <SAMP><VAR>prefix</VAR><SPAN class=file>/lib</SPAN></SAMP> (normally <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/usr/local/lib</SPAN></SAMP>, but MS-DOS/MS-Windows versions of <CODE>make</CODE> behave as if <VAR>prefix</VAR> is defined to be the root of the DJGPP installation tree).</FONT>
