With the &#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217; flag, <CODE>make</CODE> prints nothing and executes no recipes, but the exit status code it returns is zero if and only if the targets to be considered are already up to date. If the exit status is one, then some updating needs to be done. If <CODE>make</CODE> encounters an error, the exit status is two, so you can distinguish an error from a target that is not up to date.
