This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only <VAR>word</VAR> (with no trailing blanks) is seen. All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command. 
<P></P>
<P>The format of here-documents is: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>&lt;&lt;[-]<VAR>word</VAR>
        <VAR>here-document</VAR>
