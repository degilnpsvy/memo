For example, in the VGA, this memory(frame buffer)&nbsp;is mapped into <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>of the CPU address space, allowing it to be directly accessable to real mode applications, which cannot directly access the remaining memory.&nbsp;

<P>In the VGA, this memory(frame buffer) is broken up into 4 separate color planes, which are recombined to produce the actual pixel values at the time of display generation.
