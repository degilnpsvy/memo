For example, in the VGA, this memory(frame buffer) is mapped into <FONT class=clozed>the lower 1M </FONT>of the CPU address space, allowing it to be directly accessable to real mode applications, which cannot directly access the remaining memory.&nbsp;

<P>In the VGA, this memory(frame buffer) is broken up into <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, which are recombined to produce the actual pixel values at the time of display generation.
