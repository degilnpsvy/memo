<P>The Linux DRM layer contains code intended to support the needs of complex graphics devices, usually containing programmable pipelines well suited to 3D graphics acceleration. Graphics drivers in the kernel may make use of DRM functions to make tasks like memory management, interrupt handling and DMA easier, and provide a uniform interface to applications.</P>
<P>A note on versions: this guide covers features found in the DRM tree, including the TTM memory manager, output configuration and mode setting, and the new vblank internals, in addition to all the regular features found in current kernels.</P>
