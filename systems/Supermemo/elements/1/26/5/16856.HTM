The operator 
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors. If <VAR>n</VAR> is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used. If the digits in <VAR>word</VAR> do not specify a file descriptor open for output, a redirection error occurs. As a special case, if <VAR>n</VAR> is omitted, and <VAR>word</VAR> does not expand to one or more digits, the standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.
