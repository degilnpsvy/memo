The special pattern characters have the following meanings: 
<P></P>
<P>* </P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matches any string, including the null string. When the globstar shell option is enabled, and &#8216;*&#8217; is used in a filename expansion context, two adjacent &#8216;*&#8217;s used as <FONT class=clozed>a single pattern will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories</FONT>. If followed by a &#8216;/&#8217;, two adjacent &#8216;*&#8217;s will match <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
