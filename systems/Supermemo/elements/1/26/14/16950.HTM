So when an address is accessed by the CPU, it may refer to a portion of physical RAM, but it can also refer to memory of the I/O device. Thus, the CPU instructions used to access the memory can also be used for accessing devices. Each I/O device monitors the CPU's address bus and responds to any CPU access of an address assigned to that device, connecting the<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Bus (computing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)"><SPAN style="COLOR: #0b0080">data bus</SPAN></A><SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>to the desired device's<SPAN class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Hardware register" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_register"><SPAN style="COLOR: #0b0080">hardware register</SPAN></A>.
