<P>Description</P>
<P>Nodes _must_ be removed in the exact same order from the scan list as they have been added, otherwise the internal state of the memory manager will be corrupted.</P>
<P>When the scan list is empty, the selected memory nodes can be freed. An immediately following drm_mm_search_free with !DRM_MM_SEARCH_BEST will then return the just freed block (because its at the top of the free_stack list).<BR>Returns</P>
<P>True if this block should be evicted, false otherwise. Will always return false when no hole has been found.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_mm_scan_add_block &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_mm_clean
