scanf stops scanning and storing the current field and moves to the next input field (if any) in any of the following situations: 
<P></P>
<P>&#183; <FONT class=extract>The assignment suppressing character (*) appears after the % in the format specification; the current input field is scanned but not stored.</FONT> </P>
<P>&#183; width characters have been read (width is a width specification, a positive decimal integer). </P>
<P>&#183; The next character read cannot be converted under the the current format (for example, if a Z is read when the format is decimal). </P>
<P>&#183; The next character in the input field does not appear in the search set (or does appear in the inverted search set).
