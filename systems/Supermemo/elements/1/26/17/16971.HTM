Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form {<VAR>varname</VAR>}. In this case, for each redirection operator except &gt;&amp;- and &lt;&amp;-, the shell will allocate a file descriptor greater than 10 and assign it to {<VAR>varname</VAR>}. If &gt;&amp;- or &lt;&amp;- is preceded by {<VAR>varname</VAR>}, the value of <VAR>varname</VAR> defines the file descriptor to close.
