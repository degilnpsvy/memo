When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of the following. Unless otherwise noted, the values are inherited from the shell. </P>
<UL>
<LI>the shell&#8217;s open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the command 
<LI>the current working directory 
<LI>the file creation mode mask 
<LI>shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html#Environment">Environment</A>) 
<LI>traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell&#8217;s parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored </LI></UL>
