When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right. </P>
<OL>
<LI>The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing. 
<LI>The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html#Shell-Expansions">Shell Expansions</A>). If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the arguments. 
<LI>Redirections are performed as described above (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html#Redirections">Redirections</A>). 
<LI>The text after the &#8216;<SAMP>=</SAMP>&#8217; in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable. </LI></OL>
