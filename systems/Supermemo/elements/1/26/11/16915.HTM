Memory can be accessed most flexibly as it can be the source and/or target of almost every machine language instruction the CPU is capable of executing, as opposed to a very limited set of I/O instructions. 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>(In X86) I/O space is divided into 65536 addresses in the range 0-65535. Most I/O devices are configured to use a limited set of addresses that cannot conflict with another device. The primary instructions for accessing I/O are the assembly instructions "IN" and "OUT", simply enough. Most programming environments provide similarly named instructions, functions, or procedures for accessing these.</FONT>
