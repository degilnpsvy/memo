<LI><B>Read Mode 0:</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read Mode 0 is used to read one byte from a single plane of display memory. The plane read is the value of the<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/freevga/vga/graphreg.htm#04">Read Map Select</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>field. In order to read a single pixel's value in planar modes, four read operations must be performed, one for each plane. If more than one bytes worth of data is being read from the screen it is recommended that you read it a plane at a time instead of having to perform four I/O operations to the<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/freevga/vga/graphreg.htm#04">Read Map Select</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>field for each byte, as this will allow the use of faster string copy instructions and reduce the number I/O operations performed. 
<LI><B>Read Mode 1:</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read Mode 1 is used to perform comparisons against a reference color, specified by the<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/freevga/vga/graphreg.htm#02">Color Compare</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>field. If a bit is set in the<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/freevga/vga/graphreg.htm#07">Color Don't Care</A>field then the corresponding color plane is considered for by the comparison, otherwise it is ignored. Each bit in the returned result represents one comparison between the reference color from the<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/specs/freevga/vga/graphreg.htm#02">Color Compare</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>field, with the bit being set if the comparison is true. This mode is mainly used by flood fill algorithms that fill an area of a specific color, as it requires 1/4 the number of reads to determine the area that needs to be filled in addition to the additional work done by the comparison. Also an efficient "search and replace" operation that replaces one color with another can be performed when this mode is combined with Write Mode 3.</LI></UL>
