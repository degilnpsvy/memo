General Advice</B><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;when programming VGA</SPAN><BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN></B>If a program takes control of the video card and changes its state, it is considered good programming practice to keep track of the original values of any register it changes such that upon termination (normal or abnormal) it can write them back to the hardware to restore the state. Anyone who has seen a graphics application abort in the middle of a graphics screen knows how annoying this can be. Almost all of the VGA registers can be saved and restored in this fashion. In addition when changing only a particular field of a register, the value of the register should be read and the byte should be masked so that only the field one is trying to change is actually changed.
