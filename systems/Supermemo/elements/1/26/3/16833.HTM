The general format for redirecting output is: 
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR></P>
<P>If the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217;, and the <CODE>noclobber</CODE> option to the <CODE>set</CODE> builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of <VAR>word</VAR> exists and is a regular file. 
<P>If the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;|</SAMP>&#8217;, or the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217; and the <CODE>noclobber</CODE> option is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named by <VAR>word</VAR> exists.
