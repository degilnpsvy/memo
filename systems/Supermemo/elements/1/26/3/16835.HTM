The general format for redirecting output is: 
<P></P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>[<VAR>n</VAR>]&gt;[|]<VAR>word</VAR></FONT>
</PRE></DIV>
<P>If the redirection operator is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of <VAR>word</VAR> exists and is a regular file. 
<P>If the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;|</SAMP>&#8217;, or the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217; and the <CODE>noclobber</CODE> option is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named by <VAR>word</VAR> exists.
