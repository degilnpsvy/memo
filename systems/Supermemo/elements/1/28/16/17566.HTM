Some have a penchant for games, gossip or sitcoms; others desire a lifetime in formal education. Others might seek the praises of their peers (or the power they can have over them).</P>

But I believe the gap between God's mind and our own is in fact immeasurably greater than that of even an insect compared to the most intelligent human. However, because God created us "in His own image" (Genesis 1:27), that made it possible for us to have direct verbal communication with God! Thus, Adam could understand God when he was commanded not to eat "from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:17). And today we can still learn about God and all He wants us to know, through His written Word.</P>

Then try to imagine the difficulty any of us would have in understanding any topic in the same manner as God does; it would be impossible for us to even begin to grasp! But Adam didn't need to have the same knowledge that God does, nor do we today; only that which is required of us to live for Him on this earth. And after Adam disobeyed God and brought sin into His perfect creation (Romans 5:12; cf. Genesis 3:17), God showed His love for us by promising a means of salvation from our sin. We know this, because God commanded His prophets to record the significant events in history leading to the realization of that salvation. About 2000 years ago, the Messiah took on human nature and lived among us. And at a time God had planned for all along, His human nature experienced death for all our sins. His apostles were then led by the Spirit to record everything God wanted us to know, about how to be saved and to live our lives for Him.</P>
