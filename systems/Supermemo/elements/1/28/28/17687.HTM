<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Many people need to be thanked for their assistance in producing this manual. Jay Fenlason contributed many ideas and sample programs. Richard Mlynarik and Robert Chassell gave helpful comments on drafts of this manual. The paper <CITE>A Supplemental Document for <CODE>awk</CODE></CITE> by John W. Pierce of the Chemistry Department at UC San Diego, pinpointed several issues relevant both to <CODE>awk</CODE> implementation and to this manual, that would otherwise have escaped us. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=index-Stallman_002c-Richard-1></A>
<P>I would like to acknowledge Richard M. Stallman, for his vision of a better world and for his courage in founding the FSF and starting the GNU Project. </P>

<P>Robert J. Chassell provided much valuable advice on the use of Texinfo. He also deserves special thanks for convincing me <EM>not</EM> to title this Web page <CITE>How To Gawk Politely</CITE>. Karl Berry helped significantly with the TeX part of Texinfo. </P><A name=index-Hartholz_002c-Marshall></A><A name=index-Hartholz_002c-Elaine></A><A name=index-Schreiber_002c-Bert></A><A name=index-Schreiber_002c-Rita></A>
<P>I would like to thank Marshall and Elaine Hartholz of Seattle and Dr. Bert and Rita Schreiber of Detroit for large amounts of quiet vacation time in their homes, which allowed me to make significant progress on this Web page and on <CODE>gawk</CODE> itself. </P><A name=index-Hughes_002c-Phil></A>
<P>Phil Hughes of SSC contributed in a very important way by loaning me his laptop GNU/Linux system, not once, but twice, which allowed me to do a lot of work while away from home. </P><A name=index-Trueman_002c-David-1></A>
<P>David Trueman deserves special credit; he has done a yeoman job of evolving <CODE>gawk</CODE> so that it performs well and without bugs. Although he is no longer involved with <CODE>gawk</CODE>, working with him on this project was a significant pleasure. </P><A name=index-Drepper_002c-Ulrich></A><A name=index-GNITS-mailing-list></A><A name=index-mailing-list_002c-GNITS></A>
<P>The intrepid members of the GNITS mailing list, and most notably Ulrich Drepper, provided invaluable help and feedback for the design of the internationalization features. </P>
<P>Chuck Toporek, Mary Sheehan, and Claire Cloutier of O&#8217;Reilly &amp; Associates contributed significant editorial help for this Web page for the 3.1 release of <CODE>gawk</CODE>. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=index-Beebe_002c-Nelson-H_002eF_002e></A><A name=index-Buening_002c-Andreas></A><A name=index-Collado_002c-Manuel></A><A name=index-Colombo_002c-Antonio></A><A name=index-Davies_002c-Stephen></A><A name=index-Deifik_002c-Scott></A><A name=index-Demaille_002c-Akim></A><A name=index-Hankerson_002c-Darrel></A><A name=index-Jaegermann_002c-Michal></A><A name=index-Kahrs_002c-Jurgen></A><A name=index-Kasal_002c-Stepan></A><A name=index-Malmberg_002c-John></A><A name=index-Pitts_002c-Dave></A><A name=index-Ramey_002c-Chet></A><A name=index-Rankin_002c-Pat></A><A name=index-Schorr_002c-Andrew></A><A name=index-Vinschen_002c-Corinna></A><A name=index-Zaretskii_002c-Eli></A>
<P>Dr. Nelson Beebe, Andreas Buening, Dr. Manuel Collado, Antonio Colombo, Stephen Davies, Scott Deifik, Akim Demaille, Darrel Hankerson, Michal Jaegermann, J&#252;rgen Kahrs, Stepan Kasal, John Malmberg, Dave Pitts, Chet Ramey, Pat Rankin, Andrew Schorr, Corinna Vinschen, and Eli Zaretskii (in alphabetical order) make up the current <CODE>gawk</CODE> &#8220;crack portability team.&#8221; Without their hard work and help, <CODE>gawk</CODE> would not be nearly the fine program it is today. It has been and continues to be a pleasure working with this team of fine people. </P>
<P>Notable code and documentation contributions were made by a number of people. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Contributors">Contributors</A>, for the full list. </P><A name=index-Kernighan_002c-Brian-2></A>
<P>I would like to thank Brian Kernighan for invaluable assistance during the testing and debugging of <CODE>gawk</CODE>, and for ongoing help and advice in clarifying numerous points about the language. We could not have done nearly as good a job on either <CODE>gawk</CODE> or its documentation without his help. </P><A name=index-Robbins_002c-Miriam></A><A name=index-Robbins_002c-Jean></A><A name=index-Robbins_002c-Harry></A><A name=index-G_002dd></A>
<P>I must thank my wonderful wife, Miriam, for her patience through the many versions of this project, for her proofreading, and for sharing me with the computer. I would like to thank my parents for their love, and for the grace with which they raised and educated me. Finally, I also must acknowledge my gratitude to G-d, for the many opportunities He has sent my way, as well as for the gifts He has given me with which to take advantage of those opportunities. </P><BR><BR>
