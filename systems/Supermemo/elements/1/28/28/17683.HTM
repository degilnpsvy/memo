<P>The term <CODE>awk</CODE> refers to a particular program as well as to the language you use to tell this program what to do. When we need to be careful, we call the language &#8220;the <CODE>awk</CODE> language,&#8221; and the program &#8220;the <CODE>awk</CODE> utility.&#8221; This Web page explains both how to write programs in the <CODE>awk</CODE> language and how to run the <CODE>awk</CODE> utility. The term &#8220;<CODE>awk</CODE> program&#8221; refers to a program written by you in the <CODE>awk</CODE> programming language. </P><A name=index-gawk_002c-awk-and-1></A><A name=index-awk_002c-gawk-and-1></A><A name=index-POSIX-awk></A>
<P>Primarily, this Web page explains the features of <CODE>awk</CODE> as defined in the POSIX standard. It does so in the context of the <CODE>gawk</CODE> implementation. While doing so, it also attempts to describe important differences between <CODE>gawk</CODE> and other <CODE>awk</CODE> implementations.<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#FOOT4" name=DOCF4><SUP>4</SUP></A> Finally, any <CODE>gawk</CODE> features that are not in the POSIX standard for <CODE>awk</CODE> are noted. </P>
<P>This Web page has the difficult task of being both a tutorial and a reference. If you are a novice, feel free to skip over details that seem too complex. You should also ignore the many cross-references; they are for the expert user and for the online Info and HTML versions of the document. </P>
<P>There are sidebars scattered throughout the Web page. They add a more complete explanation of points that are relevant, but not likely to be of interest on first reading. All appear in the index, under the heading &#8220;sidebar.&#8221; </P>
<P>Most of the time, the examples use complete <CODE>awk</CODE> programs. Some of the more advanced sections show only the part of the <CODE>awk</CODE> program that illustrates the concept currently being described. </P>
<P>While this Web page is aimed principally at people who have not been exposed to <CODE>awk</CODE>, there is a lot of information here that even the <CODE>awk</CODE> expert should find useful. In particular, the description of POSIX <CODE>awk</CODE> and the example programs in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</A>, and in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</A>, should be of interest. </P>
<P>This Web page is split into several parts, as follows: </P>
<P>Part I describes the <CODE>awk</CODE> language and <CODE>gawk</CODE> program in detail. It starts with the basics, and continues through all of the features of <CODE>awk</CODE>. It contains the following chapters: </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Getting-Started">Getting Started</A>, provides the essentials you need to know to begin using <CODE>awk</CODE>. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Invoking-Gawk">Invoking Gawk</A>, describes how to run <CODE>gawk</CODE>, the meaning of its command-line options, and how it finds <CODE>awk</CODE> program source files. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Regexp">Regexp</A>, introduces regular expressions in general, and in particular the flavors supported by POSIX <CODE>awk</CODE> and <CODE>gawk</CODE>. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Reading-Files">Reading Files</A>, describes how <CODE>awk</CODE> reads your data. It introduces the concepts of records and fields, as well as the <CODE>getline</CODE> command. I/O redirection is first described here. Network I/O is also briefly introduced here. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Printing">Printing</A>, describes how <CODE>awk</CODE> programs can produce output with <CODE>print</CODE> and <CODE>printf</CODE>. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Expressions">Expressions</A>, describes expressions, which are the basic building blocks for getting most things done in a program. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Patterns-and-Actions">Patterns and Actions</A>, describes how to write patterns for matching records, actions for doing something when a record is matched, and the built-in variables <CODE>awk</CODE> and <CODE>gawk</CODE> use. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Arrays">Arrays</A>, covers <CODE>awk</CODE>&#8217;s one-and-only data structure: associative arrays. Deleting array elements and whole arrays is also described, as well as sorting arrays in <CODE>gawk</CODE>. It also describes how <CODE>gawk</CODE> provides arrays of arrays. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Functions">Functions</A>, describes the built-in functions <CODE>awk</CODE> and <CODE>gawk</CODE> provide, as well as how to define your own functions. </P>
<P>Part II shows how to use <CODE>awk</CODE> and <CODE>gawk</CODE> for problem solving. There is lots of code here for you to read and learn from. It contains the following chapters: </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</A>, which provides a number of functions meant to be used from main <CODE>awk</CODE> programs. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</A>, which provides many sample <CODE>awk</CODE> programs. </P>
<P>Reading these two chapters allows you to see <CODE>awk</CODE> solving real problems. </P>
<P>Part III focuses on features specific to <CODE>gawk</CODE>. It contains the following chapters: </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Advanced-Features">Advanced Features</A>, describes a number of <CODE>gawk</CODE>-specific advanced features.

<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Language-History">Language History</A>, describes how the <CODE>awk</CODE> language has evolved since its first release to present. It also describes how <CODE>gawk</CODE> has acquired features over time. </P>

It also describes how to report bugs in <CODE>gawk</CODE> and where to get other freely available <CODE>awk</CODE> implementations. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Notes">Notes</A>, describes how to disable <CODE>gawk</CODE>&#8217;s extensions, as well as how to contribute new code to <CODE>gawk</CODE>, and some possible future directions for <CODE>gawk</CODE> development. </P>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Basic-Concepts">Basic Concepts</A>, provides some very cursory background material for those who are completely unfamiliar with computer programming. </P>
