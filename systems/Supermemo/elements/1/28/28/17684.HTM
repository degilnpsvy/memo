<H3 class=unnumberedsec>Typographical Conventions</H3><A name=index-Texinfo></A>
<P>This Web page is written in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">Texinfo</A>, the GNU documentation formatting language. A single Texinfo source file is used to produce both the printed and online versions of the documentation. Because of this, the typographical conventions are slightly different than in other books you may have read. </P>
<P>Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the common shell primary and secondary prompts, &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217;. Input that you type is shown <KBD><EM>like this</EM></KBD>. Output from the command is preceded by the glyph &#8220;-|&#8221;. This typically represents the command&#8217;s standard output. Error messages, and other output on the command&#8217;s standard error, are preceded by the glyph &#8220;error&#8594;&#8221;. For example: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>$ <KBD><EM>echo hi on stdout</EM></KBD>
-| hi on stdout
$ <KBD><EM>echo hello on stderr 1&gt;&amp;2</EM></KBD>
error&#8594; hello on stderr
</PRE></DIV>
<P>In the text, command names appear in <CODE>this font</CODE>, while code segments appear in the same font and quoted, &#8216;<SAMP>like this</SAMP>&#8217;. Options look like this: <SAMP>-f</SAMP>. Some things are emphasized <EM>like this</EM>, and if a point needs to be made strongly, it is done <STRONG>like this</STRONG>. The first occurrence of a new term is usually its <EM>definition</EM> and appears in the same font as the previous occurrence of &#8220;definition&#8221; in this sentence. Finally, file names are indicated like this: <SAMP>/path/to/ourfile</SAMP>. </P>
<P>Characters that you type at the keyboard look <KBD><EM>like this</EM></KBD>. In particular, there are special characters called &#8220;control characters.&#8221; These are characters that you type by holding down both the <KBD><EM>CONTROL</EM></KBD> key and another key, at the same time. For example, a <KBD><EM>Ctrl-d</EM></KBD> is typed by first pressing and holding the <KBD><EM>CONTROL</EM></KBD> key, next pressing the <KBD><EM>d</EM></KBD> key and finally releasing both keys. </P><A name=Dark-Corners></A>

<P><I>Dark corners are basically fractal &#8212; no matter how much you illuminate, there&#8217;s always a smaller but darker one.</I> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Until the POSIX standard (and <CITE>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</CITE>), many features of <CODE>awk</CODE> were either poorly documented or not documented at all. Descriptions of such features (often called &#8220;dark corners&#8221;) are noted in this Web page with &#8220;(d.c.)&#8221;. They also appear in the index under the heading &#8220;dark corner.&#8221; </P>
<P>As noted by the opening quote, though, any coverage of dark corners is, by definition, incomplete. </P>
<P>Extensions to the standard <CODE>awk</CODE> language that are supported by more than one <CODE>awk</CODE> implementation are marked &#8220;(c.e.),&#8221; and listed in the index under &#8220;common extensions&#8221; and &#8220;extensions, common.&#8221;
