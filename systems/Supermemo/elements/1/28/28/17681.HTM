<P>The name <CODE>awk</CODE> comes from the initials of its designers: Alfred V. Aho, Peter J. Weinberger and Brian W. Kernighan. The original version of <CODE>awk</CODE> was written in 1977 at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories. In 1985, a new version made the programming language more powerful, introducing user-defined functions, multiple input streams, and computed regular expressions. This new version became widely available with Unix System V Release 3.1 (1987). The version in System V Release 4 (1989) added some new features and cleaned up the behavior in some of the &#8220;dark corners&#8221; of the language. The specification for <CODE>awk</CODE> in the POSIX Command Language and Utilities standard further clarified the language. Both the <CODE>gawk</CODE> designers and the original Bell Laboratories <CODE>awk</CODE> designers provided feedback for the POSIX specification. </P><A name=index-Rubin_002c-Paul></A><A name=index-Fenlason_002c-Jay></A><A name=index-Trueman_002c-David></A>
<P>Paul Rubin wrote the GNU implementation, <CODE>gawk</CODE>, in 1986. Jay Fenlason completed it, with advice from Richard Stallman. John Woods contributed parts of the code as well. In 1988 and 1989, David Trueman, with help from me, thoroughly reworked <CODE>gawk</CODE> for compatibility with the newer <CODE>awk</CODE>. Circa 1994, I became the primary maintainer. Current development focuses on bug fixes, performance improvements, standards compliance, and occasionally, new features. </P>
<P>In May of 1997, J&#252;rgen Kahrs felt the need for network access from <CODE>awk</CODE>, and with a little help from me, set about adding features to do this for <CODE>gawk</CODE>. At that time, he also wrote the bulk of <CITE>TCP/IP Internetworking with <CODE>gawk</CODE></CITE> (a separate document, available as part of the <CODE>gawk</CODE> distribution). His code finally became part of the main <CODE>gawk</CODE> distribution with <CODE>gawk</CODE> version 3.1. </P>
<P>John Haque rewrote the <CODE>gawk</CODE> internals, in the process providing an <CODE>awk</CODE>-level debugger. This version became available as <CODE>gawk</CODE> version 4.0, in 2011. </P>
