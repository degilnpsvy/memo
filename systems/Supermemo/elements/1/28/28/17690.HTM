<H4 class=subsection>1.1.1 One-Shot Throwaway <CODE>awk</CODE> Programs</H4>
<P>Once you are familiar with <CODE>awk</CODE>, you will often type in simple programs the moment you want to use them. Then you can write the program as the first argument of the <CODE>awk</CODE> command, like this: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>awk '<VAR>program</VAR>' <VAR>input-file1</VAR> <VAR>input-file2</VAR> &#8230;
</PRE></DIV>
<P>where <VAR>program</VAR> consists of a series of <VAR>patterns</VAR> and <VAR>actions</VAR>, as described earlier. </P><A name=index-single-quote-_0028_0027_0029></A><A name=index-_0027-_0028single-quote_0029></A>
<P>This command format instructs the <EM>shell</EM>, or command interpreter, to start <CODE>awk</CODE> and use the <VAR>program</VAR> to process records in the input file(s). There are single quotes around <VAR>program</VAR> so the shell won&#8217;t interpret any <CODE>awk</CODE> characters as special shell characters. The quotes also cause the shell to treat all of <VAR>program</VAR> as a single argument for <CODE>awk</CODE>, and allow <VAR>program</VAR> to be more than one line long. </P><A name=index-shells_002c-scripts></A><A name=index-awk-programs_002c-running_002c-from-shell-scripts></A>
<P>This format is also useful for running short or medium-sized <CODE>awk</CODE> programs from shell scripts, because it avoids the need for a separate file for the <CODE>awk</CODE> program. A self-contained shell script is more reliable because there are no other files to misplace. </P>
