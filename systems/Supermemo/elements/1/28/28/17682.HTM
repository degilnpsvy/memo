<P>The <CODE>awk</CODE> language has evolved over the years. Full details are provided in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Language-History">Language History</A>. The language described in this Web page is often referred to as &#8220;new <CODE>awk</CODE>&#8221; (<CODE>nawk</CODE>). </P><A name=index-awk_002c-versions-of></A>
<P>Because of this, there are systems with multiple versions of <CODE>awk</CODE>. Some systems have an <CODE>awk</CODE> utility that implements the original version of the <CODE>awk</CODE> language and a <CODE>nawk</CODE> utility for the new version. Others have an <CODE>oawk</CODE> version for the &#8220;old <CODE>awk</CODE>&#8221; language and plain <CODE>awk</CODE> for the new one. Still others only have one version, which is usually the new one.<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#FOOT3" name=DOCF3><SUP>3</SUP></A> </P><A name=index-nawk-utility></A><A name=index-oawk-utility></A>
<P>All in all, this makes it difficult for you to know which version of <CODE>awk</CODE> you should run when writing your programs. The best advice we can give here is to check your local documentation. Look for <CODE>awk</CODE>, <CODE>oawk</CODE>, and <CODE>nawk</CODE>, as well as for <CODE>gawk</CODE>. It is likely that you already have some version of new <CODE>awk</CODE> on your system, which is what you should use when running your programs. (Of course, if you&#8217;re reading this Web page, chances are good that you have <CODE>gawk</CODE>!) </P>
<P>Throughout this Web page, whenever we refer to a language feature that should be available in any complete implementation of POSIX <CODE>awk</CODE>, we simply use the term <CODE>awk</CODE>. When referring to a feature that is specific to the GNU implementation, we use the term <CODE>gawk</CODE>.
