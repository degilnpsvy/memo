<H3 class=unnumberedsec>How to Contribute</H3>
<P>As the maintainer of GNU <CODE>awk</CODE>, I once thought that I would be able to manage a collection of publicly available <CODE>awk</CODE> programs and I even solicited contributions. Making things available on the Internet helps keep the <CODE>gawk</CODE> distribution down to manageable size. </P>
<P>The initial collection of material, such as it is, is still available at <A href="ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff">ftp://ftp.freefriends.org/arnold/Awkstuff</A>. In the hopes of doing something more broad, I acquired the <CODE>awk.info</CODE> domain. </P>
<P>However, I found that I could not dedicate enough time to managing contributed code: the archive did not grow and the domain went unused for several years. </P>
<P>Fortunately, late in 2008, a volunteer took on the task of setting up an <CODE>awk</CODE>-related web site&#8212;<A href="http://awk.info/">http://awk.info</A>&#8212;and did a very nice job. </P>
<P>If you have written an interesting <CODE>awk</CODE> program, or have written a <CODE>gawk</CODE> extension that you would like to share with the rest of the world, please see <A href="http://awk.info/?contribute">http://awk.info/?contribute</A> for how to contribute it to the web site.
