<P>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the production and distribution of freely distributable software. It was founded by Richard M. Stallman, the author of the original Emacs editor. GNU Emacs is the most widely used version of Emacs today. </P><A name=index-GNU-Project></A><A name=index-GPL-_0028General-Public-License_0029></A><A name=index-General-Public-License_002c-See-GPL></A><A name=index-documentation_002c-online></A>
<P>The GNU<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#FOOT5" name=DOCF5><SUP>5</SUP></A> Project is an ongoing effort on the part of the Free Software Foundation to create a complete, freely distributable, POSIX-compliant computing environment. The FSF uses the &#8220;GNU General Public License&#8221; (GPL) to ensure that their software&#8217;s source code is always available to the end user. A copy of the GPL is included in this Web page for your reference (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Copying">Copying</A>). The GPL applies to the C language source code for <CODE>gawk</CODE>. To find out more about the FSF and the GNU Project online, see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/">the GNU Project&#8217;s home page</A>. This Web page may also be read from <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/">their web site</A>. </P>
<P>A shell, an editor (Emacs), highly portable optimizing C, C++, and Objective-C compilers, a symbolic debugger and dozens of large and small utilities (such as <CODE>gawk</CODE>), have all been completed and are freely available. The GNU operating system kernel (the HURD), has been released but remains in an early stage of development. </P><A name=index-Linux></A><A name=index-GNU_002fLinux></A><A name=index-operating-systems_002c-BSD_002dbased></A><A name=index-Alpha-_0028DEC_0029></A>
<P>Until the GNU operating system is more fully developed, you should consider using GNU/Linux, a freely distributable, Unix-like operating system for Intel&#174;, Power Architecture, Sun SPARC, IBM S/390, and other systems.<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#FOOT6" name=DOCF6><SUP>6</SUP></A> Many GNU/Linux distributions are available for download from the Internet. </P>
<P>(There are numerous other freely available, Unix-like operating systems based on the Berkeley Software Distribution, and some of them use recent versions of <CODE>gawk</CODE> for their versions of <CODE>awk</CODE>. <A href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>, <A href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, and <A href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> are three of the most popular ones, but there are others.) </P>
<P>The Web page you are reading is actually free&#8212;at least, the information in it is free to anyone. The machine-readable source code for the Web page comes with <CODE>gawk</CODE>; anyone may take this Web page to a copying machine and make as many copies as they like. (Take a moment to check the Free Documentation License in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#GNU-Free-Documentation-License">GNU Free Documentation License</A>.) </P><A name=index-Close_002c-Diane></A>
<P>The Web page itself has gone through a number of previous editions. Paul Rubin wrote the very first draft of <CITE>The GAWK Manual</CITE>; it was around 40 pages in size. Diane Close and Richard Stallman improved it, yielding a version that was around 90 pages long and barely described the original, &#8220;old&#8221; version of <CODE>awk</CODE>. </P>
<P>I started working with that version in the fall of 1988. As work on it progressed, the FSF published several preliminary versions (numbered 0.<VAR>x</VAR>). In 1996, Edition 1.0 was released with <CODE>gawk</CODE> 3.0.0. The FSF published the first two editions under the title <CITE>The GNU Awk User&#8217;s Guide</CITE>. </P>
<P>This edition maintains the basic structure of the previous editions. For Edition 4.0, the content has been thoroughly reviewed and updated. All references to <CODE>gawk</CODE> versions prior to 4.0 have been removed. Of significant note for this edition was <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Debugger">Debugger</A>. </P>
<P>For edition 4.1, the content has been reorganized into parts, and the major new additions are <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Arbitrary-Precision-Arithmetic">Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic</A>, and <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Dynamic-Extensions">Dynamic Extensions</A>. </P>
<P><CITE>GAWK: Effective AWK Programming</CITE> will undoubtedly continue to evolve. An electronic version comes with the <CODE>gawk</CODE> distribution from the FSF.
