<H3>Threads</H3>
<P>The general policy of GLib is that all functions are invisibly threadsafe with the exception of data structure manipulation functions, where, if you have two threads manipulating the <SPAN class=emphasis><EM>same</EM></SPAN> data structure, they must use a lock to synchronize their operation. </P>
<P>GLib is creating a worker thread for its own purposes, so GLib applications will always have at least 2 threads. </P>
<P>See the sections on <A class=link title=Threads href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Threads.html">threads</A> and <A class=link title="Thread Pools" href="https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Thread-Pools.html">threadpools</A> for GLib APIs that support multithreaded applications. </P></DIV>

<H3>Security</H3>
<P>When writing code that runs with elevated privileges, it is important to follow some basic rules of secure programming. David Wheeler has an excellent book on this topic, <A class=ulink href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/index.html" target=_top>Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO</A>. </P>
<P>When it comes to GLib and its associated libraries, GLib and GObject are generally fine to use in code that runs with elevated privileges; they don't load modules (executable code in shared objects) or run other programs 'behind your back'. GIO has to be used carefully in privileged programs, see the <A class=ulink href="https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/ch02.html" target=_top>GIO documentation</A> for details. </P></DIV></DIV>
