<H2>Filing a bug report or feature request</H2>
<P>If you encounter a bug, misfeature, or missing feature in GLib, please file a bug report on <A class=ulink href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/" target=_top>http://bugzilla.gnome.org</A>. We'd also appreciate reports of incomplete or misleading information in the GLib documentation; file those against the "docs" component of the "glib" product in Bugzilla. </P>
<P>Don't hesitate to file a bug report, even if you think we may know about it already, or aren't sure of the details. Just give us as much information as you have, and if it's already fixed or has already been discussed, we'll add a note to that effect in the report. </P>
<P>The bug tracker should definitely be used for feature requests, it's not only for bugs. We track all GLib development in Bugzilla, so it's the way to be sure the GLib developers won't forget about an issue. </P></DIV>
<DIV class=refsect1><A name=id-1.2.9.4></A>
<H2>Submitting Patches</H2>
<P>If you develop a bugfix or enhancement for GLib, please file that in Bugzilla as well. Bugzilla allows you to attach files; please attach a patch generated by the <SPAN class=command><STRONG>diff</STRONG></SPAN> utility, using the <CODE class=option>-u</CODE> option to make the patch more readable. All patches must be offered under the terms of the GNU LGPL license, so be sure you are authorized to give us the patch under those terms. </P>
<P>If you want to discuss your patch before or after developing it, mail <A class=ulink href="mailto:gtk-devel-list@gnome.org" target=_top>gtk-devel-list@gnome.org</A>. But be sure to file the Bugzilla report as well; if the patch is only on the list and not in Bugzilla, it's likely to slip through the cracks. </P></DIV>
<DIV class=refsect1><A name=id-1.2.9.5></A>
<H2>Mailing lists</H2>
<P>There are several mailing lists dedicated to GTK+ and related libraries. Discussion of GLib generally takes place on these lists. You can subscribe or view the archives of these lists on <A class=ulink href="http://mail.gnome.org/" target=_top>http://mail.gnome.org</A>. </P>
