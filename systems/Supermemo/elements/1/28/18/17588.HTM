<H3>Environment variables</H3>
<P>The runtime behaviour of GLib applications can be influenced by a number of environment variables. </P>
<P><B>Standard variables.&nbsp;</B> GLib reads standard environment variables like <CODE class=envar>LANG</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>PATH</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>HOME</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>TMPDIR</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>TZ</CODE> and <CODE class=envar>LOGNAME</CODE>. </P>
<P><B>XDG directories.&nbsp;</B> GLib consults the environment variables <CODE class=envar>XDG_DATA_HOME</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>XDG_DATA_DIRS</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</CODE>, <CODE class=envar>XDG_CACHE_HOME</CODE> and <CODE class=envar>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</CODE> for the various XDG directories. For more information, see the <A class=ulink href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html" target=_top>XDG basedir spec</A>. </P>
<P><A name=G_FILENAME_ENCODING></A><B><CODE class=envar>G_FILENAME_ENCODING</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> This environment variable can be set to a comma-separated list of character set names. GLib assumes that filenames are encoded in the first character set from that list rather than in UTF-8. The special token "@locale" can be used to specify the character set for the current locale. </P>
<P><A name=G_BROKEN_FILENAMES></A><B><CODE class=envar>G_BROKEN_FILENAMES</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> If this environment variable is set, GLib assumes that filenames are in the locale encoding rather than in UTF-8. G_FILENAME_ENCODING takes priority over G_BROKEN_FILENAMES. </P>
<P><A name=G_MESSAGES_PREFIXED></A><B><CODE class=envar>G_MESSAGES_PREFIXED</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> A list of log levels for which messages should be prefixed by the program name and PID of the application. The default is to prefix everything except <CODE class=literal>G_LOG_LEVEL_MESSAGE</CODE> and <CODE class=literal>G_LOG_LEVEL_INFO</CODE>. The possible values are <CODE class=literal>error</CODE>, <CODE class=literal>warning</CODE>, <CODE class=literal>critical</CODE>, <CODE class=literal>message</CODE>, <CODE class=literal>info</CODE> and <CODE class=literal>debug</CODE>. You can also use the special values <CODE class=literal>all</CODE> and <CODE class=literal>help</CODE>. This environment variable only affects the default log handler, g_log_default_handler(). </P>
<P><A name=G_MESSAGES_DEBUG></A><B><CODE class=envar>G_MESSAGES_DEBUG</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> A space-separated list of log domains for which informational and debug messages should be printed. By default, these messages are not printed. You can also use the special value <CODE class=literal>all</CODE>. This environment variable only affects the default log handler, g_log_default_handler(). </P>
<P><A name=G-DEBUG:CAPS></A><B><CODE class=envar>G_DEBUG</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> This environment variable can be set to a list of debug options, which cause GLib to print out different types of debugging information. </P>

<P><SPAN class=term>always-malloc</SPAN></P></TD>
<TD>
<P>This will cause all slices allocated through g_slice_alloc() and released by g_slice_free1() to be actually allocated via direct calls to g_malloc() and g_free(). This is most useful for memory checkers and similar programs that use Boehm GC alike algorithms to produce more accurate results. It can also be in conjunction with debugging features of the system's malloc() implementation such as glibc's MALLOC_CHECK_=2 to debug erroneous slice allocation code, although <CODE class=literal>debug-blocks</CODE> is usually a better suited debugging tool.</P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
<P><SPAN class=term>debug-blocks</SPAN></P></TD>
<TD>
<P>Using this option (present since GLib 2.13) engages extra code which performs sanity checks on the released memory slices. Invalid slice addresses or slice sizes will be reported and lead to a program halt. This option is for debugging scenarios. In particular, client packages sporting their own test suite should <SPAN class=emphasis><EM>always enable this option when running tests</EM></SPAN>. Global slice validation is ensured by storing size and address information for each allocated chunk, and maintaining a global hash table of that data. That way, multi-thread scalability is given up, and memory consumption is increased. However, the resulting code usually performs acceptably well, possibly better than with comparable memory checking carried out using external tools.</P>
<P>An example of a memory corruption scenario that cannot be reproduced with <CODE class=literal>G_SLICE=always-malloc</CODE>, but will be caught by <CODE class=literal>G_SLICE=debug-blocks</CODE> is as follows: </P><PRE class=programlisting>            void *slist = g_slist_alloc (); /* void* gives up type-safety */
            g_list_free (slist);            /* corruption: sizeof (GSList) != sizeof (GList) */
          </PRE></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>

<P><A name=G_RANDOM_VERSION></A><B><CODE class=envar>G_RANDOM_VERSION</CODE>.&nbsp;</B> If this environment variable is set to '2.0', the outdated pseudo-random number seeding and generation algorithms from GLib 2.0 are used instead of the newer, better ones. You should only set this variable if you have sequences of numbers that were generated with Glib 2.0 that you need to reproduce exactly. </P>

<DIV class=refsect2><A name=setlocale></A>
<H3>Locale</H3>
<P>A number of interfaces in GLib depend on the current locale in which an application is running. Therefore, most GLib-using applications should call <CODE class=function>setlocale (LC_ALL, "")</CODE> to set up the current locale. </P>
<P>On Windows, in a C program there are several locale concepts that not necessarily are synchronized. On one hand, there is the system default ANSI code-page, which determines what encoding is used for file names handled by the C library's functions and the Win32 API. (We are talking about the "narrow" functions here that take character pointers, not the "wide" ones.) </P>
<P>On the other hand, there is the C library's current locale. The character set (code-page) used by that is not necessarily the same as the system default ANSI code-page. Strings in this character set are returned by functions like <CODE class=function>strftime()</CODE>. </P></DIV>
<P>glib ships with a set of python macros for the gdb debugger. These includes pretty printers for lists, hashtables and gobject types. It also has a backtrace filter that makes backtraces with signal emissions easier to read. </P>
<P>To use this you need a recent enough gdb that supports python scripting. Gdb 7.0 should be recent enough, but branches of the "archer" gdb tree as used in Fedora 11 and Fedora 12 should work too. You then need to install glib in the same prefix as gdb so that the python gdb autoloaded files get installed in the right place for gdb to pick up. </P>
<P>General pretty printing should just happen without having to do anything special. To get the signal emission filtered backtrace you must use the "new-backtrace" command instead of the standard one. </P>
<P>There is also a new command called gforeach that can be used to apply a command on each item in a list. E.g. you can do </P><PRE class=programlisting>gforeach i in some_list_variable: print *(GtkWidget *)l
</PRE>
<P>Which would print the contents of each widget in a list of widgets. </P>

<H3>SystemTap</H3>
<P><A class=ulink href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/" target=_top>SystemTap</A> is a dynamic whole-system analysis toolkit. GLib ships with a file <CODE class=filename>glib.stp</CODE> which defines a set of probe points, which you can hook into with custom SystemTap scripts. See the files <CODE class=filename>glib.stp</CODE> and <CODE class=filename>gobject.stp</CODE> which are in your shared SystemTap scripts directory. </P></DIV>

<H3>Memory statistics</H3>
<P>g_mem_profile() will output a summary g_malloc() memory usage, if memory profiling has been enabled by calling <CODE class=literal>g_mem_set_vtable (glib_mem_profiler_table)</CODE> upon startup. </P>
<P>If GLib has been configured with <CODE class=option>--enable-debug=yes</CODE>, then g_slice_debug_tree_statistics() can be called in a debugger to output details about the memory usage of the slice allocator. </P></DIV></DIV>
