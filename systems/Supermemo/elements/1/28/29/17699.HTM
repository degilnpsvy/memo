<H3 class=section>1.4 An Example with Two Rules</H3><A name=index-awk-programs-2></A>
<P>The <CODE>awk</CODE> utility reads the input files one line at a time. For each line, <CODE>awk</CODE> tries the patterns of each of the rules. If several patterns match, then several actions are run in the order in which they appear in the <CODE>awk</CODE> program. If no patterns match, then no actions are run. </P>
<P>After processing all the rules that match the line (and perhaps there are none), <CODE>awk</CODE> reads the next line. (However, see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Next-Statement">Next Statement</A>, and also see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Nextfile-Statement">Nextfile Statement</A>). This continues until the program reaches the end of the file. For example, the following <CODE>awk</CODE> program contains two rules: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>/12/  { print $0 }
/21/  { print $0 }
</PRE></DIV>
<P>The first rule has the string &#8216;<SAMP>12</SAMP>&#8217; as the pattern and &#8216;<SAMP>print $0</SAMP>&#8217; as the action. The second rule has the string &#8216;<SAMP>21</SAMP>&#8217; as the pattern and also has &#8216;<SAMP>print $0</SAMP>&#8217; as the action. Each rule&#8217;s action is enclosed in its own pair of braces. </P>
<P>This program prints every line that contains the string &#8216;<SAMP>12</SAMP>&#8217; <EM>or</EM> the string &#8216;<SAMP>21</SAMP>&#8217;. If a line contains both strings, it is printed twice, once by each rule. </P>
<P>This is what happens if we run this program on our two sample data files, <SAMP>mail-list</SAMP> and <SAMP>inventory-shipped</SAMP>: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>$ <KBD><EM>awk '/12/ { print $0 }</EM></KBD>
&gt;      <KBD><EM>/21/ { print $0 }' mail-list inventory-shipped</EM></KBD>

<P>Note how the line beginning with &#8216;<SAMP>Jean-Paul</SAMP>&#8217; in <SAMP>mail-list</SAMP> was printed twice, once for each rule.
