<H4 class=subsection>1.1.3 Running Long Programs</H4><A name=index-awk-programs_002c-running-1></A><A name=index-awk-programs_002c-lengthy></A><A name=index-files_002c-awk-programs-in></A>
<P>Sometimes your <CODE>awk</CODE> programs can be very long. In this case, it is more convenient to put the program into a separate file. In order to tell <CODE>awk</CODE> to use that file for its program, you type: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>awk -f <VAR>source-file</VAR> <VAR>input-file1</VAR> <VAR>input-file2</VAR> &#8230;
</PRE></DIV><A name=index-_002df-option></A><A name=index-command-line_002c-option-_002df></A>
<P>The <SAMP>-f</SAMP> instructs the <CODE>awk</CODE> utility to get the <CODE>awk</CODE> program from the file <VAR>source-file</VAR>. Any file name can be used for <VAR>source-file</VAR>. For example, you could put the program: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>BEGIN { print "Don't Panic!" }
</PRE></DIV>
<P>into the file <SAMP>advice</SAMP>. Then this command: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>awk -f advice
</PRE></DIV>
<P>does the same thing as this one: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>awk "BEGIN { print \"Don't Panic!\" }"
</PRE></DIV><A name=index-quoting-in-gawk-command-lines></A>
<P>This was explained earlier (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Read-Terminal">Read Terminal</A>). Note that you don&#8217;t usually need single quotes around the file name that you specify with <SAMP>-f</SAMP>, because most file names don&#8217;t contain any of the shell&#8217;s special characters. Notice that in <SAMP>advice</SAMP>, the <CODE>awk</CODE> program did not have single quotes around it. The quotes are only needed for programs that are provided on the <CODE>awk</CODE> command line. </P><A name=index-single-quote-_0028_0027_0029-in-gawk-command-lines></A><A name=index-_0027-_0028single-quote_0029-in-gawk-command-lines></A>
<P>If you want to clearly identify your <CODE>awk</CODE> program files as such, you can add the extension <SAMP>.awk</SAMP> to the file name. This doesn&#8217;t affect the execution of the <CODE>awk</CODE> program but it does make &#8220;housekeeping&#8221; easier.
