<H3 class=section>1.2 Data Files for the Examples</H3><A name=index-input-files_002c-examples></A><A name=index-mail_002dlist-file></A>
<P>Many of the examples in this Web page take their input from two sample data files. The first, <SAMP>mail-list</SAMP>, represents a list of peoples&#8217; names together with their email addresses and information about those people. The second data file, called <SAMP>inventory-shipped</SAMP>, contains information about monthly shipments. In both files, each line is considered to be one <EM>record</EM>. </P>
<P>In the data file <SAMP>mail-list</SAMP>, each record contains the name of a person, his/her phone number, his/her email-address, and a code for their relationship with the author of the list. An &#8216;<SAMP>A</SAMP>&#8217; in the last column means that the person is an acquaintance. An &#8216;<SAMP>F</SAMP>&#8217; in the last column means that the person is a friend. An &#8216;<SAMP>R</SAMP>&#8217; means that the person is a relative: </P>
