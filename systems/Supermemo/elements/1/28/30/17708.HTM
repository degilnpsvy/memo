<H3 class=section>2.4 Naming Standard Input</H3>
<P>Often, you may wish to read standard input together with other files. For example, you may wish to read one file, read standard input coming from a pipe, and then read another file. </P>
<P>The way to name the standard input, with all versions of <CODE>awk</CODE>, is to use a single, standalone minus sign or dash, &#8216;<SAMP>-</SAMP>&#8217;. For example: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><VAR>some_command</VAR> | awk -f myprog.awk file1 - file2
</PRE></DIV>
<P>Here, <CODE>awk</CODE> first reads <SAMP>file1</SAMP>, then it reads the output of <VAR>some_command</VAR>, and finally it reads <SAMP>file2</SAMP>. </P>
<P>You may also use <CODE>"-"</CODE> to name standard input when reading files with <CODE>getline</CODE> (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Getline_002fFile">Getline/File</A>). </P>
<P>In addition, <CODE>gawk</CODE> allows you to specify the special file name <SAMP>/dev/stdin</SAMP>, both on the command line and with <CODE>getline</CODE>. Some other versions of <CODE>awk</CODE> also support this, but it is not standard. (Some operating systems provide a <SAMP>/dev/stdin</SAMP> file in the file system, however, <CODE>gawk</CODE> always processes this file name itself.)
