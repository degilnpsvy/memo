<H3 class=section>1.7 Other Features of <CODE>awk</CODE></H3><A name=index-variables></A>
<P>The <CODE>awk</CODE> language provides a number of predefined, or <EM>built-in</EM>, variables that your programs can use to get information from <CODE>awk</CODE>. There are other variables your program can set as well to control how <CODE>awk</CODE> processes your data. </P>
<P>In addition, <CODE>awk</CODE> provides a number of built-in functions for doing common computational and string-related operations. <CODE>gawk</CODE> provides built-in functions for working with timestamps, performing bit manipulation, for runtime string translation (internationalization), determining the type of a variable, and array sorting. </P>
<P>As we develop our presentation of the <CODE>awk</CODE> language, we introduce most of the variables and many of the functions. They are described systematically in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</A>, and <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Built_002din">Built-in</A>.
