Every Makefile should also define the variables <CODE>INSTALL_PROGRAM</CODE> and <CODE>INSTALL_DATA</CODE>. (The default for <CODE>INSTALL_PROGRAM</CODE> should be <CODE>$(INSTALL)</CODE>; the default for <CODE>INSTALL_DATA</CODE> should be <CODE>${INSTALL} -m 644</CODE>.) Then it should use those variables as the commands for actual installation, for executables and non-executables respectively. Minimal use of these variables is as follows: <PRE class=example>     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo
     $(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a
</PRE>
<P>However, it is preferable to support a <CODE>DESTDIR</CODE> prefix on the target files, as explained in the next section. 
<P>It is acceptable, but not required, to install multiple files in one command, with the final argument being a directory, as in: <PRE class=example>     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo bar baz $(bindir)
