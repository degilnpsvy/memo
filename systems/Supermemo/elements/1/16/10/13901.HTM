GNU distributions usually contain some files which are not source files&#8212;for example, Info files, and the output from Autoconf, Automake, Bison or Flex. Since these files normally appear in the source directory, they should always appear in the source directory, not in the build directory. So Makefile rules to update them should <FONT class=clozed>put the updated files in the source directory</FONT>.
