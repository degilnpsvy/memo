When you use <CODE>ranlib</CODE> or <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>, you should make sure nothing bad happens if the system does not have the program in question. Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean a problem. (The Autoconf &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>AC_PROG_RANLIB</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; macro can help with this.)
