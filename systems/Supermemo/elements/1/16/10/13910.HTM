Other versions of <CODE>make</CODE> use a simpler algorithm: if the file does not exist, and it is found via directory search, then that pathname is always used whether or not the target needs to be built. Thus, if the target is rebuilt it is created at the pathname discovered during directory search. 
<P><A name=index-GPATH-187></A>If, in fact, this is the behavior you want for some or all of your directories, you can <FONT class=clozed>use the <CODE>GPATH</CODE> variable to indicate this to <CODE>make</CODE>. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed><CODE>GPATH</CODE> has the same syntax and format as <CODE>VPATH</CODE> (that is, a space- or colon-delimited list of pathnames). If an out-of-date target is found by directory search in a directory that also appears in <CODE>GPATH</CODE>, then that pathname is not thrown away. The target is rebuilt using the expanded path.</FONT>
