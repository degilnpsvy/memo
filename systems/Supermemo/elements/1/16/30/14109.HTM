<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node3.html#cha:intro">1</A>: Introductory Material</B> <BR>This chapter offers some general perspective and includes some motivational examples and applications of planning algorithms. 
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node35.html#cha:discrete">2</A>: Discrete Planning</B> <BR>This chapter covers the simplest form of planning and can be considered as a springboard for entering into the rest of the book. From here, you can continue to Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A>, or even head straight to Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node420.html#par:dtp">III</A>. Sections <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node36.html#sec:dfp">2.1</A> and <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node39.html#sec:search">2.2</A> are most important for heading into Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A>. For Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node420.html#par:dtp">III</A>, Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node52.html#sec:disopt">2.3</A> is additionally useful. </LI></UL>

<P><BIG class=LARGE><B><FONT size=4>PART </FONT><A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp"><FONT size=4>II</FONT></A><FONT size=4>: Motion Planning</FONT></B></BIG> <BR>The main source of inspiration for the problems and algorithms covered in this part is robotics. The methods, however, are general enough for use in other applications in other areas, such as computational biology, computer-aided design, and computer graphics. An alternative title that more accurately reflects the kind of planning that occurs is ``Planning in Continuous State Spaces.'' 
<UL>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node76.html#cha:geom">3</A>: Geometric Representations and Transformations</B> <BR>The chapter gives important background for expressing a motion planning problem. Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node77.html#sec:gm">3.1</A> describes how to construct geometric models, and the remaining sections indicate how to transform them. Sections <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node77.html#sec:gm">3.1</A> and <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node91.html#sec:rigid">3.2</A> are important for later chapters. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node123.html#cha:cspace">4</A>: The Configuration Space</B> <BR>This chapter introduces concepts from topology and uses them to formulate the <EM>configuration space</EM>, which is the state space that arises in motion planning. Sections <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node124.html#sec:topology">4.1</A>, <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node144.html#sec:def-cspace">4.2</A>, and <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node157.html#sec:defbmp">4.3.1</A> are important for understanding most of the material in later chapters. In addition to the previously mentioned sections, all of Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node156.html#sec:col-reg">4.3</A> provides useful background for the combinatorial methods of Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node254.html#cha:comb">6</A>. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node181.html#cha:sampling">5</A>: Sampling-Based Motion Planning</B> <BR>This chapter introduces motion planning algorithms that have dominated the literature in recent years and have been applied in fields both in and out of robotics. If you understand the basic idea that the configuration space represents a continuous state space, most of the concepts should be understandable. They even apply to other problems in which continuous state spaces emerge, in addition to motion planning and robotics. Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node713.html#cha:nplan">14</A> revisits sampling-based planning, but under differential constraints. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node254.html#cha:comb">6</A>: Combinatorial Motion Planning</B> <BR>The algorithms covered in this section are sometimes called <EM>exact algorithms</EM> because they build discrete representations without losing any information. They are <EM>complete</EM>, which means that they must find a solution if one exists; otherwise, they report failure. The sampling-based algorithms have been more useful in practice, but they only achieve weaker notions of completeness. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node310.html#cha:eplan">7</A>: Extensions of Basic Motion Planning</B> <BR>This chapter introduces many problems and algorithms that are extensions of the methods from Chapters <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node181.html#cha:sampling">5</A> and <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node254.html#cha:comb">6</A>. Most can be followed with basic understanding of the material from these chapters. Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node336.html#sec:ccplan">7.4</A> covers planning for closed kinematic chains; this requires an understanding of the additional material, from Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node168.html#sec:closure">4.4</A> 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node363.html#cha:feedback">8</A>: Feedback Motion Planning</B> <BR>This is a transitional chapter that introduces feedback into the motion planning problem but still does not introduce differential constraints, which are deferred until Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node647.html#par:pdc">IV</A>. The previous chapters of Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A> focused on computing <EM>open-loop</EM> plans, which means that any errors that might occur during execution of the plan are ignored, yet the plan will be executed as planned. Using feedback yields a <EM>closed-loop</EM> plan that responds to unpredictable events during execution. </LI></UL>

Most of Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node420.html#par:dtp">III</A> addresses discrete state spaces, which can be studied immediately following Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node2.html#par:im">I</A>. However, some sections cover extensions to continuous spaces; to understand these parts, it will be helpful to have read some of Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A>. 
<UL>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node426.html#cha:decision">9</A>: Basic Decision Theory</B> <BR>The main idea in this chapter is to design the best decision for a decision maker that is confronted with interference from other decision makers. The others may be true opponents in a game or may be fictitious in order to model uncertainties. The chapter focuses on making a decision in a single step and provides a building block for Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node420.html#par:dtp">III</A> because planning under uncertainty can be considered as multi-step decision making. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node478.html#cha:seqper">10</A>: Sequential Decision Theory</B> <BR>This chapter takes the concepts from Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node426.html#cha:decision">9</A> and extends them by chaining together a sequence of basic decision-making problems. Dynamic programming concepts from Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node52.html#sec:disopt">2.3</A> become important here. For all of the problems in this chapter, it is assumed that the current state is always known. All uncertainties that exist are with respect to prediction of future states, as opposed to measuring the current state. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node536.html#cha:info">11</A>: Sensors and Information Spaces</B> <BR>The chapter extends the formulations of Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node478.html#cha:seqper">10</A> into a framework for planning when the current state is unknown during execution. Information regarding the state is obtained from sensor observations and the memory of actions that were previously applied. The information space serves a similar purpose for problems with sensing uncertainty as the configuration space has for motion planning. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node590.html#cha:infoapp">12</A>: Planning Under Sensing Uncertainty</B> <BR>This chapter covers several planning problems and algorithms that involve sensing uncertainty. This includes problems such as localization, map building, pursuit-evasion, and manipulation. All of these problems are unified under the idea of planning in information spaces, which follows from Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node536.html#cha:info">11</A>. </LI></UL>

<P><BIG class=LARGE><B><FONT size=4>PART </FONT><A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node647.html#par:pdc"><FONT size=4>IV</FONT></A><FONT size=4>: Planning Under Differential Constraints</FONT></B></BIG> <BR>This can be considered as a continuation of Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A>. Here there can be both global (obstacles) and local (differential) constraints on the continuous state spaces that arise in motion planning. Dynamical systems are also considered, which yields state spaces that include both position and velocity information (this coincides with the notion of a <EM>state space</EM> in control theory or a <EM>phase space</EM> in physics and differential equations). 
<UL>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node649.html#cha:diff">13</A>: Differential Models</B> <BR>This chapter serves as an introduction to Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node647.html#par:pdc">IV</A> by introducing numerous models that involve differential constraints. This includes constraints that arise from wheels rolling as well as some that arise from the dynamics of mechanical systems. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node713.html#cha:nplan">14</A>: Sampling-Based Planning Under Differential Constraints</B> <BR>Algorithms for solving planning problems under the models of Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node649.html#cha:diff">13</A> are presented. Many algorithms are extensions of methods from Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node181.html#cha:sampling">5</A>. All methods are sampling-based because very little can be accomplished with combinatorial techniques in the context of differential constraints. 
<P></P>
<LI><B>Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node798.html#cha:nsys">15</A>: System Theory and Analytical Techniques</B> <BR>This chapter provides an overview of the concepts and tools developed mainly in control theory literature. They are complementary to the algorithms of Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node713.html#cha:nplan">14</A> and often provide important insights or components in the development of planning algorithms under differential constraints. </LI></UL>
