<P>A planner simply constructs a plan and may be a machine or a human. If the planner is a machine, it will generally be considered as a planning algorithm. In many circumstances it is an algorithm in the strict Turing sense; however, this is not necessary. In some cases, humans become planners by developing a plan that works in all situations. For example, it is perfectly acceptable for a human to design a state machine that is connected to the environment (see Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node612.html#sec:disenv">12.3.1</A>). There are no additional inputs in this case because the human fulfills the role of the algorithm. The planning model is given as input to the human, and the human ``computes'' a plan.
