<H4><A name=SECTION02130060000000000000>A plan</A> </H4>In general, a plan imposes a specific strategy or behavior on a decision maker. A plan may simply specify a sequence of actions to be taken; however, it could be more complicated. If it is impossible to predict future states, then the plan can specify actions as a function of state. In this case, regardless of the future states, the appropriate action is determined. Using terminology from other fields, this enables <EM>feedback</EM> or <EM>reactive plans</EM>. It might even be the case that the state cannot be measured. In this case, the appropriate action must be determined from whatever information is available up to the current time. This will generally be referred to as an <EM>information state</EM>, on which the actions of a plan are conditioned.
