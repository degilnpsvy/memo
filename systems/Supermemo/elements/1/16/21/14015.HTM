Note that <CODE>ifdef</CODE> only tests whether a variable has a value. It does not expand the variable to see if that value is nonempty. Consequently, tests using <CODE>ifdef</CODE> return true for all definitions except those like <CODE>foo =</CODE>. To test for an empty value, use <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>
