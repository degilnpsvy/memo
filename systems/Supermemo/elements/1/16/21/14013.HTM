use the <CODE>GPATH</CODE> variable to indicate this to <CODE>make</CODE>. 
<P><CODE>GPATH</CODE> has the same syntax and format as <CODE>VPATH</CODE> (that is, a space- or colon-delimited list of pathnames). If an out-of-date target is found by directory search in a directory that also appears in <CODE>GPATH</CODE>, then that pathname is not thrown away. The target is rebuilt using the expanded path.
