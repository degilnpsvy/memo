The Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers and related programs, but should do so via <CODE>make</CODE> variables so that the user can substitute alternatives. Here are some of the programs we mean: <PRE class=example>     ar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex
     make makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc
</PRE>
<P>Use the following <CODE>make</CODE> variables to run those programs: <PRE class=example><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>
</PRE>
