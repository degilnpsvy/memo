<CODE>@</CODE></P>
<P><CODE>That is, <CODE>"$@"</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>"$1" "$2" &#8230;</CODE>. If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the original word. When there are no positional parameters, <CODE>"$@"</CODE> and <CODE>$@</CODE> expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed). </CODE>
