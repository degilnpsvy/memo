The syntax of the <CODE>flavor</CODE> function is: <PRE class=example>     <FONT class=clozed>$(flavor <VAR>variable</VAR>)</FONT>
</PRE>
<P>Note that <VAR>variable</VAR> is the <EM>name</EM> of a variable to inquire about, not a <EM>reference</EM> to that variable. Therefore you would not normally use a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or parentheses when writing it. (You can, however, use a variable reference in the name if you want the name not to be a constant.)
