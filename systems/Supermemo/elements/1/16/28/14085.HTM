What effect has <FONT face="Courier New">foreach</FONT> function done&nbsp;on the variable <VAR>var?</VAR> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The <CODE>foreach</CODE> function has no permanent effect on the variable <VAR>var</VAR>; its value and flavor after the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function call are the same as they were beforehand. The other values which are taken from <VAR>list</VAR> are in effect only temporarily, during the execution of <CODE>foreach</CODE>. The variable <VAR>var</VAR> is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of <CODE>foreach</CODE>. If <VAR>var</VAR> was undefined before the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function call, it is undefined after the call.
