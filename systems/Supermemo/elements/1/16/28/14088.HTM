<DD><A name=index-suffix-618></A><A name=index-suffix_002c-function-to-find-619></A><A name=index-file-name-suffix-620></A>Extracts the suffix of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>. If the file name contains a period, the suffix is everything starting with the last period. Otherwise, the suffix is the empty string. This frequently means that the result will be empty when <VAR>names</VAR> is not, and if <VAR>names</VAR> contains multiple file names, the result may contain fewer file names. </DD>
