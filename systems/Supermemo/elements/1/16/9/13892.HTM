<H3 class=section>15.2 Utilities in Makefiles</H3>
<P>Write the Makefile commands (and any shell scripts, such as <CODE>configure</CODE>) to run under <CODE>sh</CODE> (both the traditional Bourne shell and the <SPAN class=sc>posix</SPAN> shell), not <CODE>csh</CODE>. Don't use any special features of <CODE>ksh</CODE> or <CODE>bash</CODE>, or <SPAN class=sc>posix</SPAN> features not widely supported in traditional Bourne <CODE>sh</CODE>. 
<P><FONT class=extract>The <CODE>configure</CODE> script and the Makefile rules for building and installation should not use any utilities directly except these: <!-- dd find --><!-- gunzip gzip md5sum --><!-- mkfifo mknod tee uname --></FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     awk cat cmp cp diff echo egrep expr false grep install-info ln ls
     mkdir mv printf pwd rm rmdir sed sleep sort tar test touch tr true
</FONT></PRE>
<P><FONT class=extract>Compression programs such as <CODE>gzip</CODE> can be used in the <CODE>dist</CODE> rule. </FONT>
<P>Generally, stick to the widely-supported (usually <SPAN class=sc>posix</SPAN>-specified) options and features of these programs. For example, don't use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>mkdir -p</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, convenient as it may be, because a few systems don't support it at all and with others, it is not safe for parallel execution. For a list of known incompatibilities, see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/autoconf.html#Portable-Shell">Portable Shell Programming</A>. 
<P><FONT class=extract>It is a good idea to avoid creating symbolic links in makefiles, since a few file systems don't support them.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract>The Makefile rules for building and installation can also use compilers and related programs, but should do so via <CODE>make</CODE> variables so that the user can substitute alternatives. Here are some of the programs we mean: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     ar bison cc flex install ld ldconfig lex
     make makeinfo ranlib texi2dvi yacc
</FONT></PRE>
<P><FONT class=extract>Use the following <CODE>make</CODE> variables to run those programs: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     $(AR) $(BISON) $(CC) $(FLEX) $(INSTALL) $(LD) $(LDCONFIG) $(LEX)
     $(MAKE) $(MAKEINFO) $(RANLIB) $(TEXI2DVI) $(YACC)
</FONT></PRE>
<P><FONT class=extract>When you use <CODE>ranlib</CODE> or <CODE>ldconfig</CODE>, you should make sure nothing bad happens if the system does not have the program in question. Arrange to ignore an error from that command, and print a message before the command to tell the user that failure of this command does not mean a problem. (The Autoconf &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>AC_PROG_RANLIB</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; macro can help with this.) </FONT>
<P>If you use symbolic links, you should implement a fallback for systems that don't have symbolic links. 
<P><FONT class=extract>Additional utilities that can be used via Make variables are: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     chgrp chmod chown mknod</FONT>
</PRE>
<P>It is ok to use other utilities in Makefile portions (or scripts) intended only for particular systems where you know those utilities exist.
