<P><A name=index-secondary-expansion-and-static-pattern-rules-123></A><A name=index-static-pattern-rules_002c-secondary-expansion-of-124></A>Rules for secondary expansion of static pattern rules are identical to those for explicit rules, above, with one exception: <FONT class=clozed>for static pattern rules the <CODE>$$*</CODE> variable is set to the pattern stem. As with explicit rules, <CODE>$$?</CODE> is not available and expands to the empty string.</FONT>
