One difference becomes apparent if the variables are reset; consider this example: <PRE class=example>     .SECONDEXPANSION:
     AVAR = top
     onefile: $(AVAR)
     twofile: $$(AVAR)
     AVAR = bottom
</PRE>
<P>Here the prerequisite of <SAMP><SPAN class=file>onefile</SPAN></SAMP> will be expanded immediately, and resolve to the value <SAMP><SPAN class=file>top</SPAN></SAMP>, while the prerequisite of <SAMP><SPAN class=file>twofile</SPAN></SAMP> will not be full expanded until the secondary expansion and yield a value of <SAMP><SPAN class=file><FONT class=clozed>bottom</FONT></SPAN></SAMP>.
