Directory Search for Link Libraries, Makefile 
<P></P>
<P>Although the default set of files to be searched for is <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, this is customizable via the <CODE>.LIBPATTERNS</CODE> variable. Each word in the value of this variable is a pattern string. When a prerequisite like &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; is seen, <CODE>make</CODE> will replace the percent in each pattern in the list with <VAR>name</VAR> and perform the above directory searches using each library file name.
