<DT>&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>missing separator (did you mean TAB instead of 8 spaces?). Stop.</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; 
<DD><FONT class=extract>This means that <CODE>make</CODE> could not understand much of anything about the makefile line it just read. GNU <CODE>make</CODE> looks for various separators (<CODE>:</CODE>, <CODE>=</CODE>, recipe prefix characters, etc.) to indicate what kind of line it's parsing. This message means it couldn't find a valid one. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=extract>One of the most common reasons for this message is that you (or perhaps your oh-so-helpful editor, as is the case with many MS-Windows editors) have attempted to indent your recipe lines with spaces instead of a tab character. In this case, <CODE>make</CODE> will use the second form of the error above. Remember that every line in the recipe must begin with a tab character (unless you set <CODE>.RECIPEPREFIX</CODE>; see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables"><FONT class=extract>Special Variables</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>). Eight spaces do not count. See </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax"><FONT class=extract>Rule Syntax</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>.</FONT></P></DD>
