<DD><FONT class=clozed>This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a recipe: it begins with a recipe prefix character and doesn't appear to be a legal <CODE>make</CODE> directive (such as a variable assignment). Recipes must always be associated with a target. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first non-whitespace character; <CODE>make</CODE> interprets this to mean you left out the "target: prerequisite" section of a rule.
