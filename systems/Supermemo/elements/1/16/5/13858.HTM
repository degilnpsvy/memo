<DD><FONT class=clozed>The former means that you didn't provide any targets to be built on the command line, and <CODE>make</CODE> couldn't find any makefiles to read in. The latter means that some makefile was found, but it didn't contain any default goal and none was given on the command line. GNU <CODE>make</CODE> has nothing to do in these situations.
