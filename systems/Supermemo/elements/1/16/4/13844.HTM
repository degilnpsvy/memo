Directory Search for Link Libraries, Makefile 
<P></P>
<P>Although the default set of files to be searched for is <FONT class=clozed><SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR><SPAN class=file>.so</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR><SPAN class=file>.a</SPAN></SAMP></FONT>, this is customizable via the <CODE><FONT class=clozed>.LIBPATTERNS</FONT></CODE> variable. Each word in the value of this variable is a pattern string. When a prerequisite like &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; is seen, <CODE>make</CODE> will replace the percent in each pattern in the list with <VAR>name</VAR> and perform the above directory searches using each library file name. </P>
<P>The default value for <CODE>.LIBPATTERNS</CODE> is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>lib%.so lib%.a</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, which provides the default behavior described above. 
<P>You can turn off link library expansion completely by setting this variable to an empty value.
