When a wildcard matches no files, it is left as it is, so then <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> will depend on the oddly-named file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>*.o</SPAN></SAMP>. Since no such file is likely to exist, <CODE>make</CODE> will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to make <SAMP><SPAN class=file>*.o</SPAN></SAMP>. This is not what you want!
