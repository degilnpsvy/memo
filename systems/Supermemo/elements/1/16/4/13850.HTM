<FONT class=extract>A <CODE>vpath</CODE> pattern is a string containing a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character.</FONT> The string must match the file name of a prerequisite that is being searched for, the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character matching any sequence of zero or more characters (as in pattern rules; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>). For example, <CODE>%.h</CODE> matches files that end in <CODE>.h</CODE>. (If there is no &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, the pattern must match the prerequisite exactly, which is not useful very often.)

Backslashes that would otherwise quote &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters go unmolested. 
<P>When a prerequisite fails to exist in the current directory, if the <VAR>pattern</VAR> in a <CODE>vpath</CODE> directive matches the name of the prerequisite file, then the <VAR>directories</VAR> in that directive are searched just like (and before) the directories in the <CODE>VPATH</CODE> variable.
