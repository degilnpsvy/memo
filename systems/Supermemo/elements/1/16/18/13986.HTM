<FONT class=extract>We say that expansion is <DFN>immediate</DFN> if it happens during the first phase: in this case <CODE>make</CODE> will expand any variables or functions in that section of a construct as the makefile is parsed.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>We say that expansion is <DFN>deferred</DFN> if expansion is not performed immediately. Expansion of a deferred construct is not performed until either the construct appears later in an immediate context, or until the second phase.</FONT>
