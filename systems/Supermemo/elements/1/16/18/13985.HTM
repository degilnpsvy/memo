GNU <CODE>make</CODE> does its work in two distinct phases. During the first phase <FONT class=clozed>it reads all the makefiles, included makefiles, etc. and internalizes all the variables and their values, implicit and explicit rules, and constructs a dependency graph of all the targets and their prerequisites</FONT>. During the second phase, <FONT class=clozed><CODE>make</CODE> uses these internal structures to determine what targets will need to be rebuilt and to invoke the rules necessary to do so</FONT>.
