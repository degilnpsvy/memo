<FONT class=extract>If the makefiles specify a double-colon rule to remake a file with a recipe but no prerequisites, that file will always be remade (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Double_002dColon"><FONT class=extract>Double-Colon</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>).</FONT> In the case of makefiles, a makefile that has a double-colon rule with a recipe but no prerequisites will be remade every time <CODE>make</CODE> is run, and then again after <CODE>make</CODE> starts over and reads the makefiles in again. This would cause an infinite loop: <CODE>make</CODE> would constantly remake the makefile, and never do anything else. So, to avoid this, <CODE>make</CODE> will <FONT class=clozed><STRONG>not</STRONG> attempt to remake makefiles which are specified as targets of a double-colon rule with a recipe but no prerequisites.</FONT>
