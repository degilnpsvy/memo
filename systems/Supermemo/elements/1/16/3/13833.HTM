If an included makefile cannot be found in any of these directories, a warning message is generated, but <FONT class=clozed>it is not an immediately fatal error; processing of the makefile containing the <CODE>include</CODE> continues. Once it has finished reading makefiles, <CODE>make</CODE> will try to remake any that are out of date or don't exist. See </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles"><FONT class=clozed>How Makefiles Are Remade</FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>. Only after it has tried to find a way to remake a makefile and failed, will <CODE>make</CODE> diagnose the missing makefile as a fatal error.</FONT>
