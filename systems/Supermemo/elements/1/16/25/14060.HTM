Don't assume that <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.</SPAN></SAMP> is in the path for command execution. When you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the make, please make sure that it uses <SAMP><SPAN class=file><FONT class=clozed>./</FONT></SPAN></SAMP> if the program is built as part of the make or <SAMP><SPAN class=file><FONT class=clozed>$(srcdir)/</FONT></SPAN></SAMP> if the file is an unchanging part of the source code. Without one of these prefixes, the <FONT class=clozed>current search path</FONT> is used.
