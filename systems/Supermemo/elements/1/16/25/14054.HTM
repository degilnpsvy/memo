&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters in <CODE>patsubst</CODE> function invocations can be quoted with preceding backslashes (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>\</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;). Backslashes that would otherwise quote &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters go unmolested. <FONT class=extract>For example, the pattern <SAMP><SPAN class=file>the\%weird\\%pattern\\</SPAN></SAMP> has &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>the%weird\</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; preceding the operative &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character, and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>pattern\\</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character.</FONT>
