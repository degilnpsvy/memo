<DD><A name=index-patsubst-573></A>Finds whitespace-separated words in <VAR>text</VAR> that match <VAR>pattern</VAR> and replaces them with <VAR>replacement</VAR>. Here <VAR>pattern</VAR> may contain a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; which acts as a wildcard, matching any number of any characters within a word. If <VAR>replacement</VAR> also contains a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is replaced by the text that matched the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in <VAR>pattern</VAR>. Only the first &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the <VAR>pattern</VAR> and <VAR>replacement</VAR> is treated this way; any subsequent &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is unchanged.
