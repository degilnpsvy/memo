<DT>&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1. Add `+' to parent make rule.</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; 
<DD>In order for <CODE>make</CODE> processes to communicate, the parent will pass information to the child. Since this could result in problems if the child process isn't actually a <CODE>make</CODE>, the parent will only do this if it thinks the child is a <CODE>make</CODE>. The parent uses the normal algorithms to determine this (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#MAKE-Variable">How the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> Variable Works</A>). If the makefile is constructed such that the parent doesn't know the child is a <CODE>make</CODE> process, then the child will receive only part of the information necessary. In this case, the child will generate this warning message and proceed with its build in a sequential manner. </DD>
