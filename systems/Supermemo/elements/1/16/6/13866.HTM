<DT>&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>warning: -jN forced in submake: disabling jobserver mode.</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; 
<DD><FONT class=clozed>This warning and the next are generated if <CODE>make</CODE> detects error conditions related to parallel processing on systems where sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s can communicate (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_002fRecursion"><FONT class=clozed>Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>). This warning is generated if a recursive invocation of a <CODE>make</CODE> process is forced to have &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-j</SPAN><VAR>N</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; in its argument list (where <VAR>N</VAR> is greater than one). This could happen, for example, if you set the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> environment variable to &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -j2</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. In this case, the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> doesn't communicate with other <CODE>make</CODE> processes and will simply pretend it has two jobs of its own.</FONT> <BR></DD>
