<DD><FONT class=clozed>These are generated for malformed static pattern rules. The first means there's no pattern in the target section of the rule; the second means there are multiple patterns in the target section; the third means the target doesn't contain a pattern character (<CODE>%</CODE>); and the fourth means that all three parts of the static pattern rule contain pattern characters (<CODE>%</CODE>)&#8211;only the first two parts should. If you see these errors and you aren't trying to create a static pattern rule, check the value of any variables in your target and prerequisite lists to be sure they do not contain colons.
