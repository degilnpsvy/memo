<H3 class=section>3.2 What Name to Give Your Makefile</H3>
<P><A name=index-makefile-name-60></A><A name=index-name-of-makefile-61></A><A name=index-default-makefile-name-62></A><A name=index-file-name-of-makefile-63></A><!-- following paragraph rewritten to avoid overfull hbox -->By default, when <CODE>make</CODE> looks for the makefile, it tries the following names, in order: <SAMP><SPAN class=file>GNUmakefile</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>makefile</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>Makefile</SPAN></SAMP>. <A name=index-Makefile-64></A><A name=index-GNUmakefile-65></A><A name=index-makefile-66></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007bREADME_007d-67></A>Normally you should call your makefile either <SAMP><SPAN class=file>makefile</SPAN></SAMP> or <SAMP><SPAN class=file>Makefile</SPAN></SAMP>. (We recommend <SAMP><SPAN class=file>Makefile</SPAN></SAMP> because it appears prominently near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as <SAMP><SPAN class=file>README</SPAN></SAMP>.) The first name checked, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>GNUmakefile</SPAN></SAMP>, is not recommended for most makefiles. You should use this name if you have a makefile that is specific to GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, and will not be understood by other versions of <CODE>make</CODE>. Other <CODE>make</CODE> programs look for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>makefile</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>Makefile</SPAN></SAMP>, but not <SAMP><SPAN class=file>GNUmakefile</SPAN></SAMP>. 
<P>If <CODE>make</CODE> finds none of these names, it does not use any makefile. Then you must specify a goal with a command argument, and <CODE>make</CODE> will attempt to figure out how to remake it using only its built-in implicit rules. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</A>.

The arguments &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f&nbsp;</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w --> or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--file=</SPAN><VAR>name</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w --> tell <CODE>make</CODE> to read the file <VAR>name</VAR> as the makefile. If you use more than one &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--file</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option, you can specify several makefiles. All the makefiles are effectively concatenated in the order specified. The default makefile names <SAMP><SPAN class=file>GNUmakefile</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>makefile</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>Makefile</SPAN></SAMP> are not checked automatically if you specify &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--file</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;.</FONT>
