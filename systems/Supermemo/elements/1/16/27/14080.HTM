However, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even the makefiles. You can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles. When the makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and so on do apply to them. 
<P>Thus, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -f mfile -n mfile foo</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; would read the makefile <SAMP><SPAN class=file>mfile</SPAN></SAMP>, print the recipe needed to update it without actually running it, and then print the recipe needed to update <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> without running that. The recipe for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> will be the one specified by the existing contents of <SAMP><SPAN class=file>mfile</SPAN></SAMP>.
