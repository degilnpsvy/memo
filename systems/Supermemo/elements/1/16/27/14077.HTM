When you use the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--touch</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</A>), you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which targets to touch. So the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option has no effect on updating makefiles; they are <FONT class=clozed>really updated even if &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is specified</FONT>.
