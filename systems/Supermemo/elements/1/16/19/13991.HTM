<FONT class=extract>When you use the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--touch</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution"><FONT class=extract>Instead of Executing Recipes</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), you would not want to use an out-of-date makefile to decide which targets to touch. So the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option has no effect on updating makefiles; they are really updated even if &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is specified.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Likewise, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-q</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--question</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-n</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--just-print</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) do not prevent updating of makefiles, because an out-of-date makefile would result in the wrong output for other targets.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Thus, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -f mfile -n foo</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will update <SAMP><SPAN class=file>mfile</SPAN></SAMP>, read it in, and then print the recipe to update <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> and its prerequisites without running it. The recipe printed for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> will be the one specified in the updated contents of <SAMP><SPAN class=file>mfile</SPAN></SAMP>.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract>However, on occasion you might actually wish to prevent updating of even the makefiles. You can do this by specifying the makefiles as goals in the command line as well as specifying them as makefiles. When the makefile name is specified explicitly as a goal, the options &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and so on do apply to them. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=extract>Thus, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -f mfile -n mfile foo</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; would read the makefile <SAMP><SPAN class=file>mfile</SPAN></SAMP>, print the recipe needed to update it without actually running it, and then print the recipe needed to update <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> without running that. The recipe for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> will be the one specified by the existing contents of <SAMP><SPAN class=file>mfile</SPAN></SAMP>.</FONT>
