<DD>This means you've defined a normal (recursive) <CODE>make</CODE> variable <VAR>xxx</VAR> that, when it's expanded, will refer to itself (<VAR>xxx</VAR>). This is not allowed; either use simply-expanded variables (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) or use the append operator (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;).
