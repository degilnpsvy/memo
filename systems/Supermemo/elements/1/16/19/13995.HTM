it is not an immediately fatal error; processing of the makefile containing the <CODE>include</CODE> continues. Once it has finished reading makefiles, <CODE>make</CODE> will try to remake any that are out of date or don't exist. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>. Only after it has tried to find a way to remake a makefile and failed, will <CODE>make</CODE> diagnose the missing makefile as a fatal error.
