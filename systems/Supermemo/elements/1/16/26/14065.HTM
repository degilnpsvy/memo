<DD>These errors are not really <CODE>make</CODE> errors at all. They mean that a program that <CODE>make</CODE> invoked as part of a recipe returned a non-0 error code (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>Error </SPAN><VAR>NN</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;), which <CODE>make</CODE> interprets as failure, or it exited in some other abnormal fashion (with a signal of some type). See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Errors">Errors in Recipes</A>. 
<P>If no <CODE>***</CODE> is attached to the message, then the sub-process failed but the rule in the makefile was prefixed with the <CODE>-</CODE> special character, so <CODE>make</CODE> ignored the error.</P></DD>
