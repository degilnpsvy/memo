For example, consider this makefile: <PRE class=example>     .SECONDEXPANSION:
     ONEVAR = onefile
     TWOVAR = twofile
     myfile: $(ONEVAR) $$(TWOVAR)
</PRE>
<P>After the first expansion phase the prerequisites list of the <SAMP><SPAN class=file>myfile</SPAN></SAMP> target will be <CODE>onefile</CODE> and <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>; the first (unescaped) variable reference to <VAR>ONEVAR</VAR> is expanded, while the second (escaped) variable reference is simply unescaped, without being recognized as a variable reference. Now during the secondary expansion the first word is expanded again but since it contains no variable or function references it remains the value <SAMP><SPAN class=file>onefile</SPAN></SAMP>, while the second word is now a normal reference to the variable <VAR>TWOVAR</VAR>, which is expanded to the value <SAMP><SPAN class=file>twofile</SPAN></SAMP>. The final result is that there are two prerequisites, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>onefile</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>twofile</SPAN></SAMP>.
