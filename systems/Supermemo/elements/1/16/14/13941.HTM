If the specified name does not start with a slash, and the file is not found in the current directory, several other directories are searched. First, any directories you have specified with <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> are searched (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</A>). Then the following directories (if they exist) are searched, in this order: <SAMP><VAR>prefix</VAR><SPAN class=file>/include</SPAN></SAMP> (normally <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/usr/local/include</SPAN></SAMP> <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#fn-1" rel=footnote name=fnd-1><SUP>1</SUP></A>) <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/usr/gnu/include</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/usr/local/include</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/usr/include</SPAN></SAMP>.
