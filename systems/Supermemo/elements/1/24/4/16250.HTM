<DFN>Double-colon</DFN> rules are explicit rules written with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; instead of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; after the target names. They are handled differently from ordinary rules when the same target appears in more than one rule. Pattern rules with double-colons have an entirely different meaning (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Rules</A>).
