<FONT class=extract>Here is the syntax of a static pattern rule: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     <VAR>targets</VAR> ...: <VAR>target-pattern</VAR>: <VAR>prereq-patterns</VAR> ...
             <VAR>recipe</VAR>
             ...
</FONT></PRE>
<P class=noindent>The <VAR>targets</VAR> list specifies the targets that the rule applies to. The targets can contain wildcard characters, just like the targets of ordinary rules (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcards">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</A>). 
<P><A name=index-target-pattern_002c-static-_0028not-implicit_0029-264></A><A name=index-stem-265></A>The <VAR>target-pattern</VAR> and <VAR>prereq-patterns</VAR> say how to compute the prerequisites of each target. Each target is matched against the <VAR>target-pattern</VAR> to extract a part of the target name, called the <DFN>stem</DFN>. This stem is substituted into each of the <VAR>prereq-patterns</VAR> to make the prerequisite names (one from each <VAR>prereq-pattern</VAR>). 
<P>Each pattern normally contains the character &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; just once. When the <VAR>target-pattern</VAR> matches a target, the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; can match any part of the target name; this part is called the <DFN>stem</DFN>. The rest of the pattern must match exactly. For example, the target <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP> matches the pattern &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%.o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>foo</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; as the stem. The targets <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.out</SPAN></SAMP> do not match that pattern. 
<P><A name=index-prerequisite-pattern_002c-static-_0028not-implicit_0029-266></A>The prerequisite names for each target are made by substituting the stem for the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in each prerequisite pattern. For example, if one prerequisite pattern is <SAMP><SPAN class=file>%.c</SPAN></SAMP>, then substitution of the stem &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>foo</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; gives the prerequisite name <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP>. It is legitimate to write a prerequisite pattern that does not contain &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; then this prerequisite is the same for all targets.

Backslashes that would otherwise quote &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters can be quoted with more backslashes. Backslashes that quote &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters or other backslashes are removed from the pattern before it is compared to file names or has a stem substituted into it. Backslashes that are not in danger of quoting &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; characters go unmolested. For example, the pattern <SAMP><SPAN class=file>the\%weird\\%pattern\\</SPAN></SAMP> has &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>the%weird\</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; preceding the operative &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character, and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>pattern\\</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; following it. The final two backslashes are left alone because they cannot affect any &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character.
