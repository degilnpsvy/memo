<P class=noindent>To avoid this hassle (source dependence: you must always be very careful to update the makefile every time you add or remove an <CODE>#include</CODE>.), most modern C compilers can write these rules for you, by looking at the <CODE>#include</CODE> lines in the source files. Usually this is done with the &#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217; option to the compiler.
