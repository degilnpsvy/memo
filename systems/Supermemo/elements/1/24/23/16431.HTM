if <CODE>make</CODE> is killed or interrupted during the execution of their recipes, the target is not deleted. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Interrupts">Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></A>. Also, if the target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no longer needed, as is normally done. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>. In this latter respect it overlaps with the <CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> special target.
