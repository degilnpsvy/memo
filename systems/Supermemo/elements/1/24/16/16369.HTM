<FONT class=extract>When a target appears in multiple rules, all the rules must be the same type: all ordinary, or all double-colon.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>If they are double-colon, each of them is independent of the others. Each double-colon rule's recipe is executed if the target is older than any prerequisites of that rule. If there are no prerequisites for that rule, its recipe is always executed (even if the target already exists). This can result in executing none, any, or all of the double-colon rules.
