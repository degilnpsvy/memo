<DD><A name=index-parallel-execution_002c-overriding-243></A>If <CODE><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></CODE> is mentioned as a target, then this invocation of <CODE>make</CODE> will be run serially, even if the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-j</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option is given. Any recursively invoked <CODE>make</CODE> command will still run recipes in parallel (unless its makefile also contains this target). Any prerequisites on this target are ignored. </DD>
