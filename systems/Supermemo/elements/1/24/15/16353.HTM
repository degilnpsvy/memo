<DD>If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE>, then <CODE>make</CODE> will ignore errors in execution of the recipe for those particular files. The recipe for <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> (if any) is ignored. 
<P>If mentioned as a target with no prerequisites, <CODE>.IGNORE</CODE> says to ignore errors in execution of recipes for all files. This usage of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.IGNORE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is supported only for historical compatibility. Since this affects every recipe in the makefile, it is not very useful; we recommend you use the more selective ways to ignore errors in specific recipes. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Errors">Errors in Recipes</A>. </P></DD>
