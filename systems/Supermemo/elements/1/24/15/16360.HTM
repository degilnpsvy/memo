The Guile integration provides one new <CODE>make</CODE> function: <CODE>guile</CODE>. The <CODE>guile</CODE> function takes one argument which is first expanded by <CODE>make</CODE> in the normal fashion, then passed to the GNU Guile evaluator. The result of the evaluator is converted into a string and used as the expansion of the <CODE>guile</CODE> function in the makefile. 
<P>In addition, GNU <CODE>make</CODE> exposes Guile procedures for use in Guile scripts.
