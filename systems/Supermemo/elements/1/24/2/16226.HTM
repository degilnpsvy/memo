<DD>The recipe specified for <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> is used for any target for which no rules are found (either explicit rules or implicit rules). See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Last-Resort">Last Resort</A>. If a <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> recipe is specified, every file mentioned as a prerequisite, but not as a target in a rule, will have that recipe executed on its behalf.
