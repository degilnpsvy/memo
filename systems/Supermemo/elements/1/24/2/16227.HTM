<DD><A name=index-precious-targets-228></A><A name=index-preserving-with-_0040code_007b_002ePRECIOUS_007d-229></A><FONT class=extract>The targets which <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> depends on are given the following special treatment: if <CODE>make</CODE> is killed or interrupted during the execution of their recipes, the target is not deleted. See </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Interrupts"><FONT class=extract>Interrupting or Killing <CODE>make</CODE></FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. Also, if the target is an intermediate file, it will not be deleted after it is no longer needed, as is normally done. See </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Chained-Rules"><FONT class=extract>Chains of Implicit Rules</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. In this latter respect it overlaps with the <CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE> special target.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract>You can also list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%.o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) as a prerequisite file of the special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> to preserve intermediate files created by rules whose target patterns match that file's name. </FONT></P></DD>
