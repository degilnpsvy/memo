There can only be one recipe to be executed for a file. If more than one rule gives a recipe for the same file, <CODE>make</CODE> uses the last one given and prints an error message. (As a special case, if the file's name begins with a dot, no error message is printed. This odd behavior is only for compatibility with other implementations of <CODE>make</CODE><SMALL class=dots><FONT size=2>...</FONT></SMALL> you should avoid using it). Occasionally it is useful to have the same target invoke multiple recipes which are defined in different parts of your makefile; you can use <DFN>double-colon rules</DFN> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Double_002dColon">Double-Colon</A>) for this.
