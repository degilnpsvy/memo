<DT><CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> 
<DD>If you specify prerequisites for <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE>, <SAMP><SPAN class=command>make</SPAN></SAMP> assumes that these files are created by commands that generate low resolution time stamps. The recipe for the <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> target are ignored. 
<P>The high resolution file time stamps of many modern file systems lessen the chance of <SAMP><SPAN class=command>make</SPAN></SAMP> incorrectly concluding that a file is up to date. Unfortunately, some hosts do not provide a way to set a high resolution file time stamp, so commands like &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>cp -p</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; that explicitly set a file's time stamp must discard its sub-second part. If a file is created by such a command, you should list it as a prerequisite of <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> so that <SAMP><SPAN class=command>make</SPAN></SAMP> does not mistakenly conclude that the file is out of date. For example: <PRE class=example>          .LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME: dst
          dst: src
                  cp -p src dst
</PRE>
<P>Since &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>cp -p</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; discards the sub-second part of <SAMP><SPAN class=file>src</SPAN></SAMP>'s time stamp, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>dst</SPAN></SAMP> is typically slightly older than <SAMP><SPAN class=file>src</SPAN></SAMP> even when it is up to date. The <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE> line causes <SAMP><SPAN class=command>make</SPAN></SAMP> to consider <SAMP><SPAN class=file>dst</SPAN></SAMP> to be up to date if its time stamp is at the start of the same second that <SAMP><SPAN class=file>src</SPAN></SAMP>'s time stamp is in. 
<P>Due to a limitation of the archive format, archive member time stamps are always low resolution. You need not list archive members as prerequisites of <CODE>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</CODE>, as <SAMP><SPAN class=command>make</SPAN></SAMP> does this automatically. </P></DD>
