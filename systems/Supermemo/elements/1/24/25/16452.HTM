The 32 registers: 
<P></P>
<P>The choice of the number of registers is largely driven by software requirements, and a set of 32 general-purpose registers is easily the most popular in modern architectures. Using 16 would definitely not be as many as modern compilers like, but 32 is enough for a C compiler to keep frequently accessed data in registers in all but the largest and most intricate functions. Using 64 or more registers requires <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
