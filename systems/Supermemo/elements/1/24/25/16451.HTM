<DD>If <CODE>.POSIX</CODE> is mentioned as a target, then the makefile will be parsed and run in POSIX-conforming mode. This does <EM>not</EM> mean that only POSIX-conforming makefiles will be accepted: all advanced GNU <CODE>make</CODE> features are still available. Rather, this target causes <CODE>make</CODE> to behave as required by POSIX in those areas where <CODE>make</CODE>'s default behavior differs. 
<P>In particular, if this target is mentioned then recipes will be invoked as if the shell had been passed the <CODE>-e</CODE> flag: the first failing command in a recipe will cause the recipe to fail immediately. </P></DD>
