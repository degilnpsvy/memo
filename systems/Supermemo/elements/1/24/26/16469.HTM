don&#8217;t put a &#8220;#&#8221; in the leftmost column: The C preprocessor cpp treats such lines specially and gets confused, and you will probably want to use cpp. If you know your code is going to be run through cpp, you can use C-style comments: /* . . .*/. These can span multiple lines if you like.
