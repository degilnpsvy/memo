The POSIX.2 standard (<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE>) which specifies <CODE>make</CODE> does not require any of these features. 
<P></P>

<LI>Some versions of <CODE>make</CODE> invoke the shell with the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-e</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag, except under &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-k</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Testing">Testing the Compilation of a Program</A>). The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-e</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag tells the shell to exit as soon as any program it runs returns a nonzero status. We feel it is cleaner to write each line of the recipe to stand on its own and not require this special treatment. </LI>
