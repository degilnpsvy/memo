The POSIX.2 standard (<CITE>IEEE Standard 1003.2-1992</CITE>) which specifies <CODE>make</CODE> does not require any of these features.

<P>In some Unix <CODE>make</CODE>s, the automatic variable <CODE>$*</CODE> appearing in the prerequisites of a rule has the amazingly strange &#8220;feature&#8221; of expanding to the full name of the <EM>target of that rule</EM>. We cannot imagine what went on in the minds of Unix <CODE>make</CODE> developers to do this; it is utterly inconsistent with the normal definition of <CODE>$*</CODE>.
