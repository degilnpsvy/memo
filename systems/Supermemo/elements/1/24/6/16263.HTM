<H4 class=subsection>12.2.2 How Loaded Objects Are Remade</H4>
<P><A name=index-updating-loaded-objects-1063></A><A name=index-remaking-loaded-objects-1064></A><A name=index-loaded-objects_002c-remaking-of-1065></A>Loaded objects undergo the same re-make procedure as makefiles (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Remaking-Makefiles">How Makefiles Are Remade</A>). If any loaded object is recreated, then <CODE>make</CODE> will start from scratch and re-read all the makefiles, and reload the object files again. It is not necessary for the loaded object to do anything special to support this. 
<P>It's up to the makefile author to provide the rules needed for rebuilding the loaded object.
