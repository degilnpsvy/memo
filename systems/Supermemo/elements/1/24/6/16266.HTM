In cases where the built-in capabilities of GNU <CODE>make</CODE> are insufficient to your requirements there are two options for extending <CODE>make</CODE>. On systems where it's provided, you can utilize GNU Guile as an embedded scripting language (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Guile-Integration">GNU Guile Integration</A>). On systems which support dynamically loadable objects, you can write your own extension in any language (which can be compiled into such an object) and load it to provide extended capabilities (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#load-Directive">The <CODE>load</CODE> Directive</A>).
