If a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then <CODE>make</CODE> imagines this target to have been updated whenever its rule is run. This implies that all targets depending on this one will always have their recipe run. 
<P>An example will illustrate this: <PRE class=example>     clean: FORCE
             rm $(objects)
     FORCE:
</PRE>
<P>Here the target &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; satisfies the special conditions, so the target <SAMP><SPAN class=file>clean</SPAN></SAMP> that depends on it is forced to run its recipe. There is nothing special about the name &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, but that is one name commonly used this way. 
<P>As you can see, using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; this way has the same results as using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.PHONY: clean</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;.
