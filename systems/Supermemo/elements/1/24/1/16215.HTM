Since it knows that phony targets do not name actual files that could be remade from other files, <FONT class=clozed><CODE>make</CODE> skips the implicit rule search for phony targets (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rules"><FONT class=clozed>Implicit Rules</FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>)</FONT>. This is why declaring a target phony is good for performance, even if you are not worried about the actual file existing.
