In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arrays.html#Arrays">Arrays</A>), the &#8216;<SAMP>+=</SAMP>&#8217; operator can be used to append to or add to the variable&#8217;s previous value. <FONT class=extract>When &#8216;<SAMP>+=</SAMP>&#8217; is applied to a variable for which the <VAR>integer</VAR> attribute has been set, <VAR>value</VAR> is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable&#8217;s current value, which is also evaluated.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>When &#8216;<SAMP>+=</SAMP>&#8217; is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arrays.html#Arrays"><FONT class=extract>Arrays</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), the variable&#8217;s value is not unset (as it is when using &#8216;<SAMP>=</SAMP>&#8217;), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array&#8217;s maximum index (for indexed arrays), or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>When applied to a string-valued variable, <VAR>value</VAR> is expanded and appended to the variable&#8217;s value.</FONT>
