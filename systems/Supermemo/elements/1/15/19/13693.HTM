<P>This defines a shell function named <VAR>name</VAR>. The reserved word <CODE>function</CODE> is optional. If the <CODE>function</CODE> reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional. The <VAR>body</VAR> of the function is the compound command <VAR>compound-command</VAR> (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Compound-Commands.html#Compound-Commands">Compound Commands</A>). That command is usually a <VAR>list</VAR> enclosed between { and }, but may be any compound command listed above. <VAR>compound-command</VAR> is executed whenever <VAR>name</VAR> is specified as the name of a command. Any redirections (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html#Redirections">Redirections</A>) associated with the shell function are performed when the function is executed.
