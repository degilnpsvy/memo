Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the <CODE>IFS</CODE> special variable. That is, <CODE>"$*"</CODE> is equivalent to <CODE>"$1<VAR>c</VAR>$2<VAR>c</VAR>&#8230;"</CODE>, where <VAR>c</VAR> is the first character of the value of the <CODE>IFS</CODE> variable. If <CODE>IFS</CODE> is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces. If <CODE>IFS</CODE> is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
