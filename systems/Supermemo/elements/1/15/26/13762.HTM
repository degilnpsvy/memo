With old <CODE>make</CODE> programs, it was traditional practice to use this compiler feature to generate prerequisites on demand with a command like &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make depend</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. That command would create a file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>depend</SPAN></SAMP> containing all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then the makefile could use <CODE>include</CODE> to read them in (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include">Include</A>).
