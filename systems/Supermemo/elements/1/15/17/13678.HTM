In Bash,&nbsp;a sequence expression takes the form <CODE>{<VAR>x</VAR>..<VAR>y</VAR>[..<VAR>incr</VAR>]}</CODE>, where <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> are either integers or single characters, and <VAR>incr</VAR>, an optional increment, is an integer. When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each number between <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]inclusive or exclusive?</SPAN>. Supplied integers may be prefixed with &#8216;<SAMP>0</SAMP>&#8217; to force each term to have the same width. When either <VAR>x</VAR> or <VAR>y</VAR> begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary. When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>, inclusive. Note that both <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> must be of the same type. When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term. The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.
