Wildcard expansion is performed by <CODE>make</CODE> automatically in <FONT class=clozed>targets and in prerequisites</FONT>. In recipes, the <FONT class=clozed>shell</FONT> is responsible for wildcard expansion. In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens only if <FONT class=clozed>you request it explicitly with the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function</FONT>.
