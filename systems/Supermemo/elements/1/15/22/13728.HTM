If the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>~</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is followed by a word, the string represents <FONT class=clozed>the home directory of the user named by that word. For example <SAMP><SPAN class=file>~john/bin</SPAN></SAMP> expands to <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/home/john/bin</SPAN></SAMP>.</FONT>
