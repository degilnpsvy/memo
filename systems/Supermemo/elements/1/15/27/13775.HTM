Wildcard expansion is performed by <CODE>make</CODE> automatically in <FONT class=clozed>targets and in prerequisites</FONT>. In recipes, the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> is responsible for wildcard expansion. In other contexts, wildcard expansion happens only if you request it explicitly with the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function.
