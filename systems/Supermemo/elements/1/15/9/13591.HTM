<P>This is set at shell initialization. If Bash is invoked with a file of commands (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Scripts.html#Shell-Scripts">Shell Scripts</A>), <CODE>$0</CODE> is set to the name of that file. If Bash is started with the <SAMP>-c</SAMP> option (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Invoking-Bash.html#Invoking-Bash">Invoking Bash</A>), then <CODE>$0</CODE> is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present. Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke Bash, as given by argument zero.</P></DD>
