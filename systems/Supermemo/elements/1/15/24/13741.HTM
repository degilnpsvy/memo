<P class=noindent>This string, used anywhere in a makefile, is replaced by a space-separated list of names of existing files that match one of the given file name patterns. If no existing file name matches a pattern, then that pattern is omitted from the output of the <CODE>wildcard</CODE> function. Note that this is different from how unmatched wildcards behave in rules, where they are used verbatim rather than ignored (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Wildcard-Pitfall">Wildcard Pitfall</A>).
