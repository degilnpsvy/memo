<H3 class=section>4.8 Empty Target Files to Record Events</H3>
<P><A name=index-empty-targets-215></A><A name=index-targets_002c-empty-216></A><A name=index-recording-events-with-empty-targets-217></A><FONT class=clozed>The <DFN>empty target</DFN> is a variant of the phony target; it is used to hold recipes for an action that you request explicitly from time to time. Unlike a phony target, this target file can really exist; but the file's contents do not matter, and usually are empty. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The purpose of the empty target file is to record, with its last-modification time, when the rule's recipe was last executed. It does so because one of the commands in the recipe is a <CODE>touch</CODE> command to update the target file. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The empty target file should have some prerequisites (otherwise it doesn't make sense). When you ask to remake the empty target, the recipe is executed if any prerequisite is more recent than the target; in other words, if a prerequisite has changed since the last time you remade the target. Here is an example: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     print: foo.c bar.c
             lpr -p $?
             touch print
</FONT></PRE>
