<H3 class=section>4.7 Rules without Recipes or Prerequisites</H3>
<P><A name=index-force-targets-211></A><A name=index-targets_002c-force-212></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007bFORCE_007d-213></A><A name=index-rule_002c-no-recipe-or-prerequisites-214></A><FONT class=clozed><FONT class=extract>If a rule has no prerequisites or recipe, and the target of the rule is a nonexistent file, then <CODE>make</CODE> imagines this target to have been updated whenever its rule is run. This implies that all targets depending on this one will always have their recipe run.</FONT> </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed>An example will illustrate this: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     clean: FORCE
             rm $(objects)
     FORCE:
</FONT></PRE>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Here the target &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; satisfies the special conditions, so the target <SAMP><SPAN class=file>clean</SPAN></SAMP> that depends on it is forced to run its recipe. There is nothing special about the name &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, but that is one name commonly used this way. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed>As you can see, using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; this way has the same results as using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.PHONY: clean</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. </FONT>
<P>Using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.PHONY</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is more explicit and more efficient. However, other versions of <CODE>make</CODE> do not support &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.PHONY</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; thus &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>FORCE</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; appears in many makefiles.
