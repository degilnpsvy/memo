<P class=noindent>To avoid this hassle (source dependence: you must always be very careful to update the makefile every time you add or remove an <CODE>#include</CODE>.), most modern C compilers can write these rules for you, by looking at the <CODE>#include</CODE> lines in the source files. Usually this is done with the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp><FONT class=clozed>-M</FONT></SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option to the compiler. For example, the command: <PRE class=example>     cc -M main.c
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>generates the output: <PRE class=example>     main.o : main.c defs.h
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>Thus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself. The compiler will do it for you.
