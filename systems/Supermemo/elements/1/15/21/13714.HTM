Occasionally, however, you have a situation where you want to impose a specific ordering on the rules to be invoked <EM>without</EM> forcing the target to be updated if one of those rules is executed. In that case, you want to define <FONT class=clozed><DFN>order-only</DFN> prerequisites. Order-only prerequisites can be specified by placing a pipe symbol (<CODE>|</CODE>) in the prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the pipe symbol are normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     <VAR>targets</VAR> : <VAR>normal-prerequisites</VAR> | <VAR>order-only-prerequisites</VAR></FONT></PRE>
