<FONT class=extract>Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.</FONT> It is strictly textual. Bash does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string &#8216;<SAMP>${</SAMP>&#8217; is not considered eligible for brace expansion. 
<P></P>
<P>A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. </P>
<P>A { or &#8216;<SAMP>,</SAMP>&#8217; may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string &#8216;<SAMP>${</SAMP>&#8217; is not considered eligible for brace expansion.
