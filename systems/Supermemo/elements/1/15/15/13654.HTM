Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. This mechanism is similar to <VAR>filename expansion</VAR> (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion">Filename Expansion</A>), but the file names generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional <VAR>preamble</VAR>, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a seqeunce expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional <VAR>postscript</VAR>. The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.
