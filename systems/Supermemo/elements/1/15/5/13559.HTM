Placing a list of commands between parentheses causes a subshell environment to be created (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Execution-Environment.html#Command-Execution-Environment">Command Execution Environment</A>), and each of the commands in <VAR>list</VAR> to be executed in that subshell. Since the <VAR>list</VAR> is executed in a subshell, variable assignments do not remain in effect after the subshell completes.
