<P>Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression <VAR>expression</VAR>. Expressions are composed of the primaries described below in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html#Bash-Conditional-Expressions">Bash Conditional Expressions</A>. Word splitting and filename expansion are not performed on the words between the &#8216;<SAMP>[[</SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP>]]</SAMP>&#8217;; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are performed. Conditional operators such as &#8216;<SAMP>-f</SAMP>&#8217; must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.</P></DD>
