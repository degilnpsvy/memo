An additional binary operator, &#8216;<SAMP><FONT class=clozed>=~</FONT></SAMP>&#8217;, is available, with the same precedence as &#8216;<SAMP>==</SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP>!=</SAMP>&#8217;. 
<P></P>
<P>When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered an extended regular expression and matched accordingly (as in <I>regex</I>3)). The return value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise. If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the conditional expression&#8217;s return value is 2. If the shell option <CODE>nocasematch</CODE> (see the description of <CODE>shopt</CODE> in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</A>) is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force it to be matched as a string. 
<P><FONT class=extract>Substrings matched by parenthesized subexpressions within the regular expression are saved in the array variable <CODE>BASH_REMATCH</CODE>. The element of <CODE>BASH_REMATCH</CODE> with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular expression. The element of <CODE>BASH_REMATCH</CODE> with index <VAR>n</VAR> is the portion of the string matching the <VAR>n</VAR>th parenthesized subexpression.</FONT>
