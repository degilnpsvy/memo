<H2 class=chapter>11 Practical <CODE>awk</CODE> Programs</H2><A name=index-awk-programs_002c-examples-of></A>
<P><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</A>, presents the idea that reading programs in a language contributes to learning that language. This chapter continues that theme, presenting a potpourri of <CODE>awk</CODE> programs for your reading enjoyment. There are three sections. The first describes how to run the programs presented in this chapter. </P>
<P>The second presents <CODE>awk</CODE> versions of several common POSIX utilities. These are programs that you are hopefully already familiar with, and therefore, whose problems are understood. By reimplementing these programs in <CODE>awk</CODE>, you can focus on the <CODE>awk</CODE>-related aspects of solving the programming problem. </P>
<P>The third is a grab bag of interesting programs. These solve a number of different data-manipulation and management problems. Many of the programs are short, which emphasizes <CODE>awk</CODE>&#8217;s ability to do a lot in just a few lines of code. </P>
<P>Many of these programs use library functions presented in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Library-Functions">Library Functions</A>. </P>
