<P>Modern systems support the notion of <EM>locales</EM>: a way to tell the system about the local character set and language. </P>
<P>Once upon a time, the locale setting used to affect regexp matching (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Ranges-and-Locales">Ranges and Locales</A>), but this is no longer true. </P>
<P>Locales can affect record splitting. For the normal case of &#8216;<SAMP>RS = "\n"</SAMP>&#8217;, the locale is largely irrelevant. For other single-character record separators, setting &#8216;<SAMP>LC_ALL=C</SAMP>&#8217; in the environment will give you much better performance when reading records. Otherwise, <CODE>gawk</CODE> has to make several function calls, <EM>per input character</EM>, to find the record terminator. </P>
<P>According to POSIX, string comparison is also affected by locales (similar to regular expressions). The details are presented in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#POSIX-String-Comparison">POSIX String Comparison</A>. </P>
<P>Finally, the locale affects the value of the decimal point character used when <CODE>gawk</CODE> parses input data. This is discussed in detail in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Conversion">Conversion</A>.
