<H4 class=subsection>7.1.1 Regular Expressions as Patterns</H4><A name=index-patterns_002c-expressions-as></A><A name=index-regular-expressions_002c-as-patterns-1></A>
<P>Regular expressions are one of the first kinds of patterns presented in this book. This kind of pattern is simply a regexp constant in the pattern part of a rule. Its meaning is &#8216;<SAMP>$0 ~ /<VAR>pattern</VAR>/</SAMP>&#8217;. The pattern matches when the input record matches the regexp. For example: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>/foo|bar|baz/  { buzzwords++ }
END            { print buzzwords, "buzzwords seen" }
</PRE></DIV>
