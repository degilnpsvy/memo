<H4 class=subsection>6.3.4 Conditional Expressions</H4><A name=index-conditional-expressions></A><A name=index-expressions_002c-conditional></A><A name=index-expressions_002c-selecting></A>
<P>A <EM>conditional expression</EM> is a special kind of expression that has three operands. It allows you to use one expression&#8217;s value to select one of two other expressions. The conditional expression is the same as in the C language, as shown here: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><VAR>selector</VAR> ? <VAR>if-true-exp</VAR> : <VAR>if-false-exp</VAR>
</PRE></DIV>
<P>There are three subexpressions. The first, <VAR>selector</VAR>, is always computed first. If it is &#8220;true&#8221; (not zero or not null), then <VAR>if-true-exp</VAR> is computed next and its value becomes the value of the whole expression. Otherwise, <VAR>if-false-exp</VAR> is computed next and its value becomes the value of the whole expression. For example, the following expression produces the absolute value of <CODE>x</CODE>: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>x &gt;= 0 ? x : -x
</PRE></DIV><A name=index-side-effects_002c-conditional-expressions></A>
<P>Each time the conditional expression is computed, only one of <VAR>if-true-exp</VAR> and <VAR>if-false-exp</VAR> is used; the other is ignored. This is important when the expressions have side effects. For example, this conditional expression examines element <CODE>i</CODE> of either array <CODE>a</CODE> or array <CODE>b</CODE>, and increments <CODE>i</CODE>: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>x == y ? a[i++] : b[i++]
</PRE></DIV>
<P>This is guaranteed to increment <CODE>i</CODE> exactly once, because each time only one of the two increment expressions is executed and the other is not. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Arrays">Arrays</A>, for more information about arrays. </P><A name=index-differences-in-awk-and-gawk_002c-line-continuations></A><A name=index-line-continuations_002c-gawk></A><A name=index-gawk_002c-line-continuation-in></A>
<P>As a minor <CODE>gawk</CODE> extension, a statement that uses &#8216;<SAMP>?:</SAMP>&#8217; can be continued simply by putting a newline after either character. However, putting a newline in front of either character does not work without using backslash continuation (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Statements_002fLines">Statements/Lines</A>). If <SAMP>--posix</SAMP> is specified (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Options">Options</A>), then this extension is disabled.
