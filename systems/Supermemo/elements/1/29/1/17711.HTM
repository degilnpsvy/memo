<H4 class=subsection>2.5.2 The <CODE>AWKLIBPATH</CODE> Environment Variable</H4><A name=index-AWKLIBPATH-environment-variable></A><A name=index-directories_002c-searching-for-shared-libraries></A><A name=index-search-paths_002c-for-shared-libraries></A><A name=index-differences-in-awk-and-gawk_002c-AWKLIBPATH-environment-variable></A>
<P>The <CODE>AWKLIBPATH</CODE> environment variable is similar to the <CODE>AWKPATH</CODE> variable, but it is used to search for shared libraries specified with the <SAMP>-l</SAMP> option rather than for source files. If the library is not found, the path is searched again after adding the appropriate shared library suffix for the platform. For example, on GNU/Linux systems, the suffix &#8216;<SAMP>.so</SAMP>&#8217; is used. The search path specified is also used for libraries loaded via the &#8216;<SAMP>@load</SAMP>&#8217; keyword (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Loading-Shared-Libraries">Loading Shared Libraries</A>).
