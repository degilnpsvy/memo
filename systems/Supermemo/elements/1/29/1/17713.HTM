<H3 class=section>2.6 <CODE>gawk</CODE>&#8217;s Exit Status</H3><A name=index-exit-status_002c-of-gawk></A>
<P>If the <CODE>exit</CODE> statement is used with a value (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Exit-Statement">Exit Statement</A>), then <CODE>gawk</CODE> exits with the numeric value given to it. </P>
<P>Otherwise, if there were no problems during execution, <CODE>gawk</CODE> exits with the value of the C constant <CODE>EXIT_SUCCESS</CODE>. This is usually zero. </P>
<P>If an error occurs, <CODE>gawk</CODE> exits with the value of the C constant <CODE>EXIT_FAILURE</CODE>. This is usually one. </P>
<P>If <CODE>gawk</CODE> exits because of a fatal error, the exit status is 2. On non-POSIX systems, this value may be mapped to <CODE>EXIT_FAILURE</CODE>.
