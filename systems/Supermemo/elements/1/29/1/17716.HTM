<P>This section describes features and/or command-line options from previous releases of <CODE>gawk</CODE> that are either not available in the current version or that are still supported but deprecated (meaning that they will <EM>not</EM> be in the next release). </P>
<P>The process-related special files <SAMP>/dev/pid</SAMP>, <SAMP>/dev/ppid</SAMP>, <SAMP>/dev/pgrpid</SAMP>, and <SAMP>/dev/user</SAMP> were deprecated in <CODE>gawk</CODE> 3.1, but still worked. As of version 4.0, they are no longer interpreted specially by <CODE>gawk</CODE>. (Use <CODE>PROCINFO</CODE> instead; see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Auto_002dset">Auto-set</A>.)
