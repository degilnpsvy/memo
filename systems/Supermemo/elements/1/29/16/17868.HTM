<H4 class=subsection>10.2.6 Merging an Array into a String</H4><A name=index-libraries-of-awk-functions_002c-merging-arrays-into-strings></A><A name=index-functions_002c-library_002c-merging-arrays-into-strings></A><A name=index-strings_002c-merging-arrays-into></A><A name=index-arrays_002c-merging-into-strings></A>
<P>When doing string processing, it is often useful to be able to join all the strings in an array into one long string. The following function, <CODE>join()</CODE>, accomplishes this task. It is used later in several of the application programs (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Sample-Programs">Sample Programs</A>). </P>
<P>Good function design is important; this function needs to be general but it should also have a reasonable default behavior. It is called with an array as well as the beginning and ending indices of the elements in the array to be merged. This assumes that the array indices are numeric&#8212;a reasonable assumption since the array was likely created with <CODE>split()</CODE> (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#String-Functions">String Functions</A>): </P><A name=index-join_0028_0029-user_002ddefined-function></A>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example># join.awk --- join an array into a string

function join(array, start, end, sep,    result, i)
{
    if (sep == "")
       sep = " "
    else if (sep == SUBSEP) # magic value
       sep = ""
    result = array[start]
    for (i = start + 1; i &lt;= end; i++)
        result = result sep array[i]
    return result

<P>An optional additional argument is the separator to use when joining the strings back together. If the caller supplies a nonempty value, <CODE>join()</CODE> uses it; if it is not supplied, it has a null value. In this case, <CODE>join()</CODE> uses a single space as a default separator for the strings. If the value is equal to <CODE>SUBSEP</CODE>, then <CODE>join()</CODE> joins the strings with no separator between them. <CODE>SUBSEP</CODE> serves as a &#8220;magic&#8221; value to indicate that there should be no separation between the component strings.<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#FOOT67" name=DOCF67><SUP>67</SUP></A>
