<H4 class=subsection>10.3.2 Rereading the Current File</H4><A name=index-files_002c-reading></A>
<P>Another request for a new built-in function was for a <CODE>rewind()</CODE> function that would make it possible to reread the current file. The requesting user didn&#8217;t want to have to use <CODE>getline</CODE> (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Getline">Getline</A>) inside a loop. </P>
<P>However, as long as you are not in the <CODE>END</CODE> rule, it is quite easy to arrange to immediately close the current input file and then start over with it from the top. For lack of a better name, we&#8217;ll call it <CODE>rewind()</CODE>: </P><A name=index-rewind_0028_0029-user_002ddefined-function></A>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example># rewind.awk --- rewind the current file and start over

function rewind(    i)
{
    # shift remaining arguments up
    for (i = ARGC; i &gt; ARGIND; i--)
        ARGV[i] = ARGV[i-1]

    # make sure gawk knows to keep going
    ARGC++

    # make current file next to get done
    ARGV[ARGIND+1] = FILENAME

    # do it
    nextfile
}
</PRE></DIV>
<P>This code relies on the <CODE>ARGIND</CODE> variable (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Auto_002dset">Auto-set</A>), which is specific to <CODE>gawk</CODE>. If you are not using <CODE>gawk</CODE>, you can use ideas presented in the previous section to either update <CODE>ARGIND</CODE> on your own or modify this code as appropriate. </P>
<P>The <CODE>rewind()</CODE> function also relies on the <CODE>nextfile</CODE> keyword (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Nextfile-Statement">Nextfile Statement</A>).
