<H4 class=subsection>4.9.8 Using <CODE>getline</CODE> into a Variable from a Coprocess</H4><A name=index-variables_002c-getline-command-into_002c-using-3></A>
<P>When you use &#8216;<SAMP><VAR>command</VAR> |&amp; getline <VAR>var</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;, the output from the coprocess <VAR>command</VAR> is sent through a two-way pipe to <CODE>getline</CODE> and into the variable <VAR>var</VAR>. </P>
<P>In this version of <CODE>getline</CODE>, none of the built-in variables are changed and the record is not split into fields. The only variable changed is <VAR>var</VAR>. However, <CODE>RT</CODE> is set.
