<H4 class=subsection>4.9.3 Using <CODE>getline</CODE> from a File</H4><A name=index-getline-from-a-file></A><A name=index-input-redirection></A><A name=index-redirection-of-input></A><A name=index-_003c-_0028left-angle-bracket_0029_002c-_003c-operator-_0028I_002fO_0029></A><A name=index-left-angle-bracket-_0028_003c_0029_002c-_003c-operator-_0028I_002fO_0029></A><A name=index-operators_002c-input_002foutput></A>
<P>Use &#8216;<SAMP>getline &lt; <VAR>file</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; to read the next record from <VAR>file</VAR>. Here <VAR>file</VAR> is a string-valued expression that specifies the file name. &#8216;<SAMP>&lt; <VAR>file</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; is called a <EM>redirection</EM> because it directs input to come from a different place. For example, the following program reads its input record from the file <SAMP>secondary.input</SAMP> when it encounters a first field with a value equal to 10 in the current input file: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>{
    if ($1 == 10) {
         getline &lt; "secondary.input"
         print
    } else
         print
}
</PRE></DIV>
<P>Because the main input stream is not used, the values of <CODE>NR</CODE> and <CODE>FNR</CODE> are not changed. However, the record it reads is split into fields in the normal manner, so the values of <CODE>$0</CODE> and the other fields are changed, resulting in a new value of <CODE>NF</CODE>. <CODE>RT</CODE> is also set. </P><A name=index-POSIX-awk_002c-_003c-operator-and></A>
<P>According to POSIX, &#8216;<SAMP>getline &lt; <VAR>expression</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; is ambiguous if <VAR>expression</VAR> contains unparenthesized operators other than &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217;; for example, &#8216;<SAMP>getline &lt; dir "/" file</SAMP>&#8217; is ambiguous because the concatenation operator is not parenthesized. You should write it as &#8216;<SAMP>getline &lt; (dir "/" file)</SAMP>&#8217; if you want your program to be portable to all <CODE>awk</CODE> implementations.
