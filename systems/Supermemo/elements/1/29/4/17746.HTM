<H4 class=subsection>4.9.4 Using <CODE>getline</CODE> into a Variable from a File</H4><A name=index-variables_002c-getline-command-into_002c-using-1></A>
<P>Use &#8216;<SAMP>getline <VAR>var</VAR> &lt; <VAR>file</VAR></SAMP>&#8217; to read input from the file <VAR>file</VAR>, and put it in the variable <VAR>var</VAR>. As above, <VAR>file</VAR> is a string-valued expression that specifies the file from which to read. </P>
<P>In this version of <CODE>getline</CODE>, none of the built-in variables are changed and the record is not split into fields. The only variable changed is <VAR>var</VAR>.<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#FOOT26" name=DOCF26><SUP>26</SUP></A> For example, the following program copies all the input files to the output, except for records that say &#8216;<SAMP>@include&nbsp;<VAR>filename</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w -->. Such a record is replaced by the contents of the file <VAR>filename</VAR>: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>{
     if (NF == 2 &amp;&amp; $1 == "@include") {
          while ((getline line &lt; $2) &gt; 0)
               print line
          close($2)
     } else
          print
}
</PRE></DIV>
<P>Note here how the name of the extra input file is not built into the program; it is taken directly from the data, specifically from the second field on the &#8216;<SAMP>@include</SAMP>&#8217; line. </P>
<P>The <CODE>close()</CODE> function is called to ensure that if two identical &#8216;<SAMP>@include</SAMP>&#8217; lines appear in the input, the entire specified file is included twice. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Close-Files-And-Pipes">Close Files And Pipes</A>. </P>
<P>One deficiency of this program is that it does not process nested &#8216;<SAMP>@include</SAMP>&#8217; statements (i.e., &#8216;<SAMP>@include</SAMP>&#8217; statements in included files) the way a true macro preprocessor would. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Igawk-Program">Igawk Program</A>, for a program that does handle nested &#8216;<SAMP>@include</SAMP>&#8217; statements.
