<P>According to the POSIX standard, files named on the <CODE>awk</CODE> command line must be text files. It is a fatal error if they are not. Most versions of <CODE>awk</CODE> treat a directory on the command line as a fatal error. </P>
<P>By default, <CODE>gawk</CODE> produces a warning for a directory on the command line, but otherwise ignores it. If either of the <SAMP>--posix</SAMP> or <SAMP>--traditional</SAMP> options is given, then <CODE>gawk</CODE> reverts to treating a directory on the command line as a fatal error.
