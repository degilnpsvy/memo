<H3 class=section>5.1 The <CODE>print</CODE> Statement</H3>
<P>The <CODE>print</CODE> statement is used for producing output with simple, standardized formatting. Specify only the strings or numbers to print, in a list separated by commas. They are output, separated by single spaces, followed by a newline. The statement looks like this: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>print <VAR>item1</VAR>, <VAR>item2</VAR>, &#8230;
</PRE></DIV>
<P>The entire list of items may be optionally enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses are necessary if any of the item expressions uses the &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217; relational operator; otherwise it could be confused with an output redirection (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Redirection">Redirection</A>). </P>
<P>The items to print can be constant strings or numbers, fields of the current record (such as <CODE>$1</CODE>), variables, or any <CODE>awk</CODE> expression. Numeric values are converted to strings and then printed. </P><A name=index-records_002c-printing></A><A name=index-lines_002c-blank_002c-printing></A><A name=index-text_002c-printing></A>
<P>The simple statement &#8216;<SAMP>print</SAMP>&#8217; with no items is equivalent to &#8216;<SAMP>print $0</SAMP>&#8217;: it prints the entire current record. To print a blank line, use &#8216;<SAMP>print ""</SAMP>&#8217;, where <CODE>""</CODE> is the empty string. To print a fixed piece of text, use a string constant, such as <CODE>"Don't&nbsp;Panic"</CODE><!-- /@w -->, as one item. If you forget to use the double-quote characters, your text is taken as an <CODE>awk</CODE> expression, and you will probably get an error. Keep in mind that a space is printed between any two items.
