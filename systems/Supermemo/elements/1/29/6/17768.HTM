<P><CODE>gawk</CODE> programs can open a two-way TCP/IP connection, acting as either a client or a server. This is done using a special file name of the form: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><SAMP>/<VAR>net-type</VAR>/<VAR>protocol</VAR>/<VAR>local-port</VAR>/<VAR>remote-host</VAR>/<VAR>remote-port</VAR></SAMP>
</PRE></DIV>
<P>The <VAR>net-type</VAR> is one of &#8216;<SAMP>inet</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>inet4</SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP>inet6</SAMP>&#8217;. The <VAR>protocol</VAR> is one of &#8216;<SAMP>tcp</SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP>udp</SAMP>&#8217;, and the other fields represent the other essential pieces of information for making a networking connection. These file names are used with the &#8216;<SAMP>|&amp;</SAMP>&#8217; operator for communicating with a coprocess (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Two_002dway-I_002fO">Two-way I/O</A>). This is an advanced feature, mentioned here only for completeness. Full discussion is delayed until <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#TCP_002fIP-Networking">TCP/IP Networking</A>.
