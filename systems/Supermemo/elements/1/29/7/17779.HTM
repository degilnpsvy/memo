<H4 class=subsubsection>6.1.3.1 Using Variables in a Program</H4>
<P>Variables let you give names to values and refer to them later. Variables have already been used in many of the examples. The name of a variable must be a sequence of letters, digits, or underscores, and it may not begin with a digit. Case is significant in variable names; <CODE>a</CODE> and <CODE>A</CODE> are distinct variables. </P>
<P>A variable name is a valid expression by itself; it represents the variable&#8217;s current value. Variables are given new values with <EM>assignment operators</EM>, <EM>increment operators</EM>, and <EM>decrement operators</EM>. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Assignment-Ops">Assignment Ops</A>. In addition, the <CODE>sub()</CODE> and <CODE>gsub()</CODE> functions can change a variable&#8217;s value, and the <CODE>match()</CODE>, <CODE>patsplit()</CODE> and <CODE>split()</CODE> functions can change the contents of their array parameters. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#String-Functions">String Functions</A>. </P><A name=index-variables_002c-built_002din></A><A name=index-variables_002c-initializing></A>
<P>A few variables have special built-in meanings, such as <CODE>FS</CODE> (the field separator), and <CODE>NF</CODE> (the number of fields in the current input record). See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Built_002din-Variables">Built-in Variables</A>, for a list of the built-in variables. These built-in variables can be used and assigned just like all other variables, but their values are also used or changed automatically by <CODE>awk</CODE>. All built-in variables&#8217; names are entirely uppercase. </P>
<P>Variables in <CODE>awk</CODE> can be assigned either numeric or string values. The kind of value a variable holds can change over the life of a program. By default, variables are initialized to the empty string, which is zero if converted to a number. There is no need to explicitly &#8220;initialize&#8221; a variable in <CODE>awk</CODE>, which is what you would do in C and in most other traditional languages.
