<H4 class=subsection>9.2.5 Functions and Their Effects on Variable Typing</H4>
<P><CODE>awk</CODE> is a very fluid language. It is possible that <CODE>awk</CODE> can&#8217;t tell if an identifier represents a scalar variable or an array until runtime. Here is an annotated sample program: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>function foo(a)
{
    a[1] = 1   # parameter is an array
}

BEGIN {
    b = 1
    foo(b)  # invalid: fatal type mismatch

    foo(x)  # x uninitialized, becomes an array dynamically
    x = 1   # now not allowed, runtime error
}
</PRE></DIV>
<P>In this example, the first call to <CODE>foo()</CODE> generates a fatal error, so <CODE>gawk</CODE> will not report the second error. If you comment out that call, though, then <CODE>gawk</CODE> will report the second error. </P>
<P>Usually, such things aren&#8217;t a big issue, but it&#8217;s worth being aware of them.
