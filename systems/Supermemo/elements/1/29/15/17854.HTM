<H4 class=subsubsection>9.2.3.1 Writing A Function Call</H4>
<P>A function call consists of the function name followed by the arguments in parentheses. <CODE>awk</CODE> expressions are what you write in the call for the arguments. Each time the call is executed, these expressions are evaluated, and the values become the actual arguments. For example, here is a call to <CODE>foo()</CODE> with three arguments (the first being a string concatenation): </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>foo(x y, "lose", 4 * z)
</PRE></DIV>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>CAUTION:</B> Whitespace characters (spaces and TABs) are not allowed between the function name and the open-parenthesis of the argument list. If you write whitespace by mistake, <CODE>awk</CODE> might think that you mean to concatenate a variable with an expression in parentheses. However, it notices that you used a function name and not a variable name, and reports an error. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
