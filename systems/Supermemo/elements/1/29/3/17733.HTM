<H4 class=subsection>4.5.1 Whitespace Normally Separates Fields</H4><A name=index-newlines_002c-as-field-separators></A><A name=index-whitespace_002c-as-field-separators></A>
<P>Fields are normally separated by whitespace sequences (spaces, TABs, and newlines), not by single spaces. Two spaces in a row do not delimit an empty field. The default value of the field separator <CODE>FS</CODE> is a string containing a single space, <CODE>"&nbsp;"</CODE><!-- /@w -->. If <CODE>awk</CODE> interpreted this value in the usual way, each space character would separate fields, so two spaces in a row would make an empty field between them. The reason this does not happen is that a single space as the value of <CODE>FS</CODE> is a special case&#8212;it is taken to specify the default manner of delimiting fields. </P>
<P>If <CODE>FS</CODE> is any other single character, such as <CODE>","</CODE>, then each occurrence of that character separates two fields. Two consecutive occurrences delimit an empty field. If the character occurs at the beginning or the end of the line, that too delimits an empty field. The space character is the only single character that does not follow these rules.
