<P class=docText>Things get interesting later, when you execute the macro. When it gets to the point in the macro where you typed <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x q</SPAN>, Emacs prints a query in the minibuffer:</P><PRE>Proceed with macro? (y, n, RET, C-l, C-r)
</PRE><BR>
<P class=docText>The responses listed here are analogous to those in query-replace:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>y</SPAN> means to continue and go on to the next repetition, if any.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>n</SPAN> means to stop executing the macro but go on to the next repetition, if any.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN> means to <FONT class=clozed>stop executing the macro and cancel any repetitions</FONT>.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-r</SPAN> starts <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-l</SPAN> puts the line the cursor is on in the middle of the screen (this is good for getting a feel for the context). Similar to <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-r</SPAN>, Emacs again asks if you want to proceed with the macro, and you have to answer <SPAN class=docEmphBold>y</SPAN>, <SPAN class=docEmphBold>n</SPAN>, or <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>.</P>
<LI>
<P class=docList>Pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-g</SPAN> (although not listed as an option) cancels the query and the macro; it is similar to pressing <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN>.</P></LI></UL>
