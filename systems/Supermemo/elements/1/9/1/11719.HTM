<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">a) A given transaction object shall not be sent through multiple parallel sockets or along multiple parallel paths simultaneously. Each transaction instance shall take a unique well-defined path through a set of components and sockets which shall remain fixed for the lifetime of the transaction instance and is common to the transport, direct memory and debug transport interfaces. Of course, different transactions sent through a given socket may take different paths, that is, they may be routed differently. Also, note that a component may choose dynamically whether to act as an interconnect component or as a target. </SPAN></P>

Similarly, a downstream component should not know and should not need to know whether it is connected to an interconnect component or directly to an initiator. </SPAN></P>

<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">c) For a write transaction (TLM_WRITE_COMMAND), a response status of TLM_OK_RESPONSE shall indicate that the write command has completed successfully at the target. The target is obliged to set the response status before returning from <B>b_transport</B>, before sending BEGIN_RESP along the backward or return path, or before returning TLM_COMPLETED. In other words, an interconnect component is not permitted to signal the completion of a write transaction without having had confirmation of successful completion from the target. The intent of this rule is to guarantee the coherency of the storage within the target simulation model. </SPAN></P>

The target is obliged to set the response status before returning from <B>b_transport</B>, before sending BEGIN_RESP along the backward or return path, or before returning TLM_COMPLETED. </SPAN>
