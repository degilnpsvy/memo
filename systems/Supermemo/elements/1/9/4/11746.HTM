<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">The multi-sockets are a variation on the tagged simple sockets that permit a single socket to be bound to multiple sockets on other components. In contrast to the tagged simple sockets, which identify through which socket an incoming call arrives, a multi-socket callback is able to identify from which socket on another component an incoming interface method call arrives, using the multi-port index number as the tag. Unlike the other convenience sockets, the multi-sockets also support hierarchical child-to-parent socket binding on both the initiator and target side. </SPAN>
