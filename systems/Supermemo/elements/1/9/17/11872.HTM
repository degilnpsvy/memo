If you keep a handle on the spawned process, then it is also possible to await the termination of the process via the sc_process_handle::terminated_event() method. For example: </P>
<P>1sc_process_handle h = </P>
<P>2 sc_spawn(sc_bind(&amp;spawned_thread)); </P>
<P>3// Do some work </P>
<P>4... </P>
<P>5// Wait for spawned thread to return 6wait(h.terminated_event()); </P>
