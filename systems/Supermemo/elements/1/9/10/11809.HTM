The availability of graphic algorithms, DSP algorithms, and a plethora of other application libraries make the writing of initial models very easy. An extreme example is the use of an H.264 algorithm freely available on the web that is matched with about 20 lines of SystemC code to produce a graphics model in a matter of hours for an initial system model.</FONT></SPAN>
