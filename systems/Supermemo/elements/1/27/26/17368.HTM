<P>Description</P>
<P>Provides a default plane update handler for primary planes. This is handler is called in response to a userspace SetPlane operation on the plane with a non-NULL framebuffer. We call the driver's modeset handler to update the framebuffer.</P>
<P>SetPlane on a primary plane of a disabled CRTC is not supported, and will return an error.</P>
<P>Note that we make some assumptions about hardware limitations that may not be true for all hardware -- 1) Primary plane cannot be repositioned. 2) Primary plane cannot be scaled. 3) Primary plane must cover the entire CRTC. 4) Subpixel positioning is not supported. Drivers for hardware that don't have these restrictions can provide their own implementation rather than using this helper.<BR>RETURNS</P>
