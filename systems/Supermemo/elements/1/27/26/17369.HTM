<P>plane</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plane to disable </P>
<P>Description</P>
<P>Provides a default plane disable handler for primary planes. This is handler is called in response to a userspace SetPlane operation on the plane with a NULL framebuffer parameter. It unconditionally fails the disable call with -EINVAL the only way to disable the primary plane without driver support is to disable the entier CRTC. Which does not match the plane -&gt;disable hook.</P>
<P>Note that some hardware may be able to disable the primary plane without disabling the whole CRTC. Drivers for such hardware should provide their own disable handler that disables just the primary plane (and they'll likely need to provide their own update handler as well to properly re-enable a disabled primary plane).<BR>RETURNS</P>
<P>Unconditionally returns -EINVAL.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_primary_helper_update &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_primary_helper_destroy
