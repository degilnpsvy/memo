<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; framebuffer to remove </P>
<P>Description</P>
<P>Cleanup framebuffer. This function is intended to be used from the drivers -&gt;destroy callback. It can also be used to clean up driver private framebuffers embedded into a larger structure.</P>
<P>Note that this function does not remove the fb from active usuage - if it is still used anywhere, hilarity can ensue since userspace could call getfb on the id and get back -EINVAL. Obviously no concern at driver unload time.</P>
<P>Also, the framebuffer will not be removed from the lookup idr - for user-created framebuffers this will happen in in the rmfb ioctl. For driver-private objects (e.g. for fbdev) drivers need to explicitly call drm_framebuffer_unregister_private.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_framebuffer_unregister_private &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_framebuffer_remove
