Cleanup</P>
<P>The DRM core manages its objects' lifetime. When an object is not needed anymore the core calls its destroy function, which must clean up and free every resource allocated for the object. Every drm_*_init call must be matched with a corresponding drm_*_cleanup call to cleanup CRTCs (drm_crtc_cleanup), planes (drm_plane_cleanup), encoders (drm_encoder_cleanup) and connectors (drm_connector_cleanup). Furthermore, connectors that have been added to sysfs must be removed by a call to drm_connector_unregister before calling drm_connector_cleanup.</P>
<P>Connectors state change detection must be cleanup up with a call to drm_kms_helper_poll_fini.
