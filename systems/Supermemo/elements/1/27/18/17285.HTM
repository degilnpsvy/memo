<P>Description</P>
<P>Returns the number of bytes transferred on success, or a negative error code on failure. -EIO is returned if the request was NAKed by the sink or if the retry count was exceeded. If not all bytes were transferred, this function returns -EPROTO. Errors from the underlying AUX channel transfer function, with the exception of -EBUSY (which causes the transaction to be retried), are propagated to the caller.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>i2c_dp_aux_add_bus &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_dp_dpcd_write
