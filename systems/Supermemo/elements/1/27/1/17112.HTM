Driver Initialization
<P>Driver Information<BR>Device Registration<BR>Driver Load</P>
<P>At the core of every DRM driver is a drm_driver structure. Drivers typically statically initialize a drm_driver structure, and then pass it to one of the drm_*_init() functions to register it with the DRM subsystem.</P>
<P>Newer drivers that no longer require a drm_bus structure can alternatively use the low-level device initialization and registration functions such as drm_dev_alloc() and drm_dev_register() directly.</P>
<P>The drm_driver structure contains static information that describes the driver and features it supports, and pointers to methods that the DRM core will call to implement the DRM API. We will first go through the drm_driver static information fields, and will then describe individual operations in details as they get used in later sections.
