<P>Util to queue up work to run from work-queue context after flip/vblank. Typically this can be used to defer unref of framebuffer's, cursor bo's, etc until after vblank. The APIs are all safe (and lockless) for up to one producer and once consumer at a time. The single-consumer aspect is ensured by committing the queued work to a single work-queue.
