<P>Description</P>
<P>Try to set mode on crtc. Give crtc and its associated connectors a chance to fixup or reject the mode prior to trying to set it. This is an internal helper that drivers could e.g. use to update properties that require the entire output pipe to be disabled and re-enabled in a new configuration. For example for changing whether audio is enabled on a hdmi link or for changing panel fitter or dither attributes. It is also called by the drm_crtc_helper_set_config helper function to drive the mode setting sequence.<BR>Returns</P>
<P>True if the mode was set successfully, false otherwise.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_helper_disable_unused_functions &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_crtc_helper_set_config
