<P>fb_helper</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fb_helper device struct <BR>bpp_sel</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bpp value to use for the framebuffer configuration </P>
<P>Description</P>
<P>Scans the CRTCs and connectors and tries to put together an initial setup. At the moment, this is a cloned configuration across all heads with a new framebuffer object as the backing store.</P>
<P>Note that this also registers the fbdev and so allows userspace to call into the driver through the fbdev interfaces.</P>
<P>This function will call down into the -&gt;fb_probe callback to let the driver allocate and initialize the fbdev info structure and the drm framebuffer used to back the fbdev. drm_fb_helper_fill_var and drm_fb_helper_fill_fix are provided as helpers to setup simple default values for the fbdev info structure.<BR>RETURNS</P>
<P>Zero if everything went ok, nonzero otherwise.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_fb_helper_fill_var &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event
