<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the drm_fb_helper </P>
<P>Description</P>
<P>Scan the connectors attached to the fb_helper and try to put together a setup after *notification of a change in output configuration.</P>
<P>Called at runtime, takes the mode config locks to be able to check/change the modeset configuration. Must be run from process context (which usually means either the output polling work or a work item launched from the driver's hotplug interrupt).</P>
<P>Note that drivers may call this even before calling drm_fb_helper_initial_config but only aftert drm_fb_helper_init. This allows for a race-free fbcon setup and will make sure that the fbdev emulation will not miss any hotplug events.<BR>RETURNS</P>
<P>0 on success and a non-zero error code otherwise.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_fb_helper_initial_config &nbsp;Home&nbsp; struct drm_fb_helper_funcs
