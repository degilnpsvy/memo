<P>drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event &#8212; fire off KMS hotplug events<BR>Synopsis<BR>void drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event (&nbsp;struct drm_device * dev);<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Arguments</P>
<P>dev</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drm_device whose connector state changed </P>
<P>Description</P>
<P>This function fires off the uevent for userspace and also calls the output_poll_changed function, which is most commonly used to inform the fbdev emulation code and allow it to update the fbcon output configuration.</P>
<P>Drivers should call this from their hotplug handling code when a change is detected. Note that this function does not do any output detection of its own, like drm_helper_hpd_irq_event does - this is assumed to be done by the driver already.</P>
<P>This function must be called from process context with no mode setting locks held.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes_nomerge &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_kms_helper_poll_disable
