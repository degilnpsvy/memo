<P>This library provides some helper code for output probing. It provides an implementation of the core connector-&gt;fill_modes interface with drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes.</P>
<P>It also provides support for polling connectors with a work item and for generic hotplug interrupt handling where the driver doesn't or cannot keep track of a per-connector hpd interrupt.</P>
<P>This helper library can be used independently of the modeset helper library. Drivers can also overwrite different parts e.g. use their own hotplug handling code to avoid probing unrelated outputs.
