<P>The plane, CRTC, encoder and connector functions provided by the drivers implement the DRM API. They're called by the DRM core and ioctl handlers to handle device state changes and configuration request. As implementing those functions often requires logic not specific to drivers, mid-layer helper functions are available to avoid duplicating boilerplate code.</P>
<P>The DRM core contains one mid-layer implementation. The mid-layer provides implementations of several plane, CRTC, encoder and connector functions (called from the top of the mid-layer) that pre-process requests and call lower-level functions provided by the driver (at the bottom of the mid-layer). For instance, the drm_crtc_helper_set_config function can be used to fill the struct drm_crtc_funcs set_config field. When called, it will split the set_config operation in smaller, simpler operations and call the driver to handle them.</P>
<P>To use the mid-layer, drivers call drm_crtc_helper_add, drm_encoder_helper_add and drm_connector_helper_add functions to install their mid-layer bottom operations handlers, and fill the drm_crtc_funcs, drm_encoder_funcs and drm_connector_funcs structures with pointers to the mid-layer top API functions. Installing the mid-layer bottom operation handlers is best done right after registering the corresponding KMS object.</P>
<P>The mid-layer is not split between CRTC, encoder and connector operations. To use it, a driver must provide bottom functions for all of the three KMS entities.<BR>Prev &nbsp;Up&nbsp; Next<BR>drm_modeset_unlock &nbsp;Home&nbsp; drm_helper_move_panel_connectors_to_head
