<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>ESL techniques evolved in response to increasing design complexity and increasingly shortened design cycles in many industries. Systems, Integrated Circuits (ICs), and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are becoming large. Many more multi-disciplinary trade-offs are required to optimize the hardware, the software, and the overall system performance. </FONT></SPAN>
