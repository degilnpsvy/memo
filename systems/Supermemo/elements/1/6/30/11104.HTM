This specification accelerates hardware development. Alternatively, activities can be focused on refinement for behavioral synthesis with even greater schedule and productivity improvements. Some of the questions asked during this set of activities are: </FONT></SPAN></P>

Many times during the development process, an RTL designer will ask an architect specific questions where the answer will significantly (or even slightly) affect performance. When the architect is asked about option A or option B, he or she will answer yes or both because of the absence of information, thus adding complexity. With a model that can be refined, the architect can model the affect of A and B and possibly come back with the answer that neither option helps. The refined model saves design time, verification time, and silicon area. </FONT></SPAN>
