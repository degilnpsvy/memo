<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Architectural modeling is about hardware and software partitioning, subsystem partitioning. It is also about bus performance analysis, and other initial refinements based on a power management concept. This modeling also includes existing intellectual property and designs as well as other product-based technical and management critical parameters and trade-offs. Some of the questions asked during this activity are: </FONT></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>This activity can be performed using SystemC or another language that supports modeling or simulation concurrency. In the past, some teams have used C or C++. These teams have been forced to develop a custom simulation kernel to support concurrency. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Many times for this activity, non-critical portions of the system are modeled using &#8220;traffic generators&#8221;. These generators are based on an estimate of the bus traffic generated by the non-critical elements. As the model is refined, the blocks are refined to add the details required to start running software. There are several vendors of EDA tools that have offerings that can help accelerate this activity. </FONT></SPAN>
