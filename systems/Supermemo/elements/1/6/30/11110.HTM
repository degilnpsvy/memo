<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>SystemC is not yet a common skill set among all system engineers whether they be of a hardware or software orientation. However, SystemC is based on C++ and object-oriented techniques, which are a common skill set to all recent graduates of leading engineering schools. Many older engineers have also upgraded themselves by learning C++ or Java and the corresponding object-oriented techniques and thinking. These are the skills that enable a great SystemC modeler. </FONT></SPAN>
