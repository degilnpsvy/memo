Another view, show-branch, provides concise, one-line summaries for the current development branch: 
<P></P>
<P>$ git show-branch <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> </P>
<P>[master] Convert to HTML </P>
<P>[master^] Initial contents of public_html</P>
<P>The phrase <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> reveals up to an additional 10 more versions, but only two exist so far and so both are shown. (The default in this case would list only the most recent commit.) The name master is the default branch name.
