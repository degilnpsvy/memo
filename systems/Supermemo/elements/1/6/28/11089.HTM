<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Anyone who has been part of a system design realizes that typical design cycles are experiencing more and more schedule pressure. Part of the reason for the drive for a shortened design cycle is the perceived need for a very fast product cycle in the marketplace. Anyone who has attempted to find a cell phone or a laptop &#8220;just like my last one&#8221;, even just nine months after buying the &#8220;latest and greatest&#8221; model, will find themselves looking long and hard throughout the web for a replacement[2This scenario describes a recent experience by one of the authors.].</FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Many are under the misguided assumption that shorter design cycles imply reduced development expenses. If the scope of the new system is not reduced and the schedule is reduced, then additional resources are required. In this scenario, a shorter design cycle actually requires more resources (expenses). The project requires more communication between development groups (because of concurrent design), more tools, more people, and more of everything. ESL and TLM are an approach to reduce the cost of development through more efficient communication and through reduced rework. </FONT></SPAN>
