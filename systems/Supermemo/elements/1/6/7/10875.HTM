If you already have a block of storage allocated by malloc, but you no longer need all the space allocated to it, you can make it smaller by calling <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> with both the object pointer and the new desired size as arguments. realloc guarantees that the contents of the smaller object match the beginning of the original object.
