You supply a simple pattern for the generated file name, as the string at path. The pattern should be a valid filename (including path information if you wish) ending with at least six `X' characters. The generated filename will match the leading part of the name you supply, with the trailing `X' characters replaced by some combination of digits and letters. With mkstemps, the `X' characters end suffixlen bytes before the end of the string.</P>
