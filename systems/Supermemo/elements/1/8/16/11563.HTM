Firstly, to permit TLM-2.0 sockets that carry variations on the core attribute set of the generic payload to be specialized with the same protocol traits class, thus allowing them to be bound together directly with no need for adaption or bridging. Secondly, to permit easy adaption between different protocols where both are based on the same generic payload and extension mechanism. Without the extension mechanism, the addition of any new attribute to the generic payload would require the definition of a new transaction class, leading to the need for multiple adapters. The extension </FONT></SPAN><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">mechanism allows variations to be introduced into the generic payload, thus reducing the amount of coding work that needs to be done to traverse sockets that carry different protocols. </SPAN>
