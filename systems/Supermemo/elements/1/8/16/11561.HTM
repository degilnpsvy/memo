<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">Being <I>ignorable </I>means that any component other than the component that added the extension is permitted to behave as if the extension were absent. As a consequence, the component that added the ignorable extension cannot rely on any other component reacting in any way to the presence of the extension, and a component receiving an ignorable extension cannot rely on other components having recognized that extension. This definition applies to generic payload extensions and to extended phases alike. A component shall not fail and shall not generate an error response because of the absence of an ignorable extension. In this sense, ignorable extensions are also non-mandatory extensions. A component may fail or generate an error response because of the presence of an ignorable extension, but also has the choice of ignoring the extension. In general, an ignorable extension can be thought of as one for which there exists an obvious and safe default value such that any interconnect component or target can behave normally in the absence of the given extension by assuming the default value. An example might be the privilege level associated with a transaction, where the default is the lowest level. Ignorable extensions may be used to transport auxiliary, side-band, or simulation-related information or meta-data. For example, a unique transaction identifier, the wall-time when the transaction was created, or a diagnostic filename. Ignorable extensions are permitted by the base protocol. </SPAN>
