<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>The STL is the most popular of these libraries, and it comes with all modern C++ compilers. The STL contains many useful data types and structures, including an improved character array known as string, and generic containers such as the vector&lt;T&gt;, map&lt;T,T&gt;, set&lt;T&gt;, list&lt;T&gt;, and deque&lt;T&gt;. These containers can be manipulated by STL algorithms such as for_each(), count(), min_element(), max_element(), search(), transform(), reverse(), and sort(). These are just a few of the algorithms available.</FONT></SPAN>
