Assuming one process has locked a resource using sc_mutex, the second process wanting the same resource must call <FONT class=clozed>trylock() in conjunction with a wait() or return. The second process must use wait() or return between calls to trylock() to allow the first process some simulation cycles to finish and unlock the resource. Otherwise, the simulation will hang with infinite calls to trylock()</FONT>.</FONT></SPAN>
