<P class=Default style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Cycle-accurate modeling is beyond the scope of TLM-2.0 at present. It is possible to create cycle-accurate models using SystemC and TLM-1 as it stands, but the requirement for the standardization of a cycle-accurate coding style still remains an open issue, possibly to be addressed by a future OSCI standard. In principle only, the approximately-timed coding style might be extended to encompass cycle-accurate modeling by defining an appropriate set of phases and rules. The TLM-2.0 release includes sufficient machinery for this, but the details have not been worked out. </SPAN>
