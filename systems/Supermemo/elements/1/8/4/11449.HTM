<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">A model may switch between the loosely-timed and approximately-timed coding style during simulation. The idea is to run rapidly through the reset and boot sequence at the loosely-timed level, then switch to approximately timed modeling for more detailed analysis once the simulation has reached an interesting stage.</SPAN>
