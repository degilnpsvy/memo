The <FONT class=clozed>simulated time </FONT>is the time being modeled by the simulation, and it may be less than or greater than the simulation&#8217;s wall-clock time. For example, it might take 2 seconds by your watch (wall-clock time) to simulate 15 ms (simulated time) of your design, but it may only take 1 second (processor time) of the CPU because another program was hogging the processor.
