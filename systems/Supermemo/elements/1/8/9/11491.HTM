<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">A caller may annotate a delay onto an <I>nb_transport </I>call. This is an indication to the callee that the transaction should be processed <I>as if </I>it had been received after the given delay. An approximately-timed callee would typically handle this situation by putting the transaction into a payload event queue for processing when simulation time has <I>caught up </I>with the annotated delay. Depending on the implementation of the payload event queue, this processing may occur either in a SystemC process sensitive to an event notification from the payload event queue or in a callback registered with the payload event queue. Delays can be annotated onto calls on the forward and backward paths and the corresponding return paths. An approximately-timed initiator would be expected to handle incoming transactions on both the forward return path and the backward path in the same way. Similarly, an approximately-timed target would be expected to handle incoming transactions on both the backward return path and the forward path in the same way.</SPAN>
