<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">The old TLM-1 and the new TLM-2.0 interfaces are both part of the TLM-2.0 standard. The TLM-1 blocking and non-blocking interfaces are still useful in their own right. For example, a number of vendors have used these interfaces in building functional verification environments for HDL designs. The intent is that the similarity between the old and new blocking transport interfaces should ease the task of building adapters between legacy models using the TLM-1 interfaces and the new TLM-2.0 interfaces.</SPAN>
