Static sensitivity is implemented by applying the SystemC sensitive command to an SC_METHOD or SC_THREAD at elaboration time (within the constructor). Dynamic sensitivity lets a simulation process change its sensitivity on the fly. The SC_METHOD implements dynamic sensitivity with a <FONT class=clozed>next_trigger(arg)</FONT> command. The SC_THREAD implements dynamic sensitivity with a <FONT class=clozed>wait(arg)</FONT> command. Both SC_METHOD and SC_THREAD <FONT class=clozed>can</FONT> switch between dynamic and static sensitivity during simulation.</FONT></SPAN>
