A write command is a generic payload transaction with the command attribute equal to TLM_WRITE_COMMAND. An ignore command is a generic payload transaction with the command attribute equal to TLM_IGNORE_COMMAND </SPAN></P>

The intent is that an ignore command may be used as a vehicle for transporting generic payload extensions without the need to execute a read or a write command, although the rules concerning extensions are the same for all three commands. </SPAN></P>

In particular, it shall not modify the value of the local array that would be modified by a write command, or modify the value of the array pointed to by the data pointer attribute. The target may, however, use the value of any attribute in the generic payload, including any extensions. </SPAN></P>

A component that routes read and write commands differently would be expected to return an error response. </SPAN></P>
