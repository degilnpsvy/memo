<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">The generic payload class contains a set of private attributes, and a set of public access functions to get and set the values of those attributes. The exact implementation of those access functions is implementation-defined. The majority of the attributes are set by the initiator and shall not be modified by any interconnect component or target. Only the address, DMI allowed, response status and extension attributes may be modified by an interconnect component or by the target. In the case of a read command, the target may also modify the data array. </SPAN>
