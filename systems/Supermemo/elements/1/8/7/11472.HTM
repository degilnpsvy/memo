<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A temporally decoupled initiator may run at a notional local time in advance of the current simulation time, in which case it should pass a non-zero value for the time argument to <B>b_transport</B>, as shown below. The initiator and target may each further advance the local time offset by increasing the value of the time argument. Adding the time argument returned from the call to the current simulation time gives the notional time at which each the transaction completes, but simulation time itself cannot advance until the initiator thread yields. The body of <B>b_transport </B>may itself call <B>wait</B>, in which case the local time offset should be reset to zero. In the diagram below, the final return from the initiator happens at simulation time 140ns, but with an annotated delay of 5ns, giving an effective local time of 145ns.</SPAN>
