<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A temporally decoupled initiator will continue to advance local time until the time quantum is exceeded. At that point, the initiator is obliged to synchronize by suspending execution, directly or indirectly calling the <B>wait </B>method with the local time as an argument. This allows other initiators in the model to run and to catch up, which effectively means that the initiators execute in turn, each being responsible for determining when to hand back control by keeping track of its own local time. The original initiator should only run again after simulation time has advanced to the next quantum. The primary purpose of delays in the loosely-timed coding style is to allow each initiator to determine when to hand back control. It is best if the model does not rely on the details of the timing in order to function correctly. Within each quantum, the transactions generated by a given initiator happen in strict sequential order, but without advancing simulation time. The local time is not tracked by the SystemC scheduler.</SPAN>
