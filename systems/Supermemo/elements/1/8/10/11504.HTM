<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">a) A DMI region can only be invalidated by means of a target or interconnect component making a call to <B>invalidate_direct_mem_ptr</B>. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">b) An initiator is responsible for checking that a DMI region is still valid before using the associated DMI pointer, subject to the following considerations. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">c) The co-routine semantics of SystemC guarantee that once an initiator has started running, no other SystemC process will be able to run until the initiator yields. In particular, no other SystemC process would be able to invalidate a DMI pointer (although the current process might). As a consequence, a temporally decoupled initiator does not necessarily need to check repeatedly that a given DMI region is still valid each time it uses the associated DMI pointer. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">d) It is possible that an interface method call made from an initiator may cause another component to call <B>invalidate_direct_mem_ptr</B>, thus invalidating a DMI region being used by that initiator. This could be true of a temporally decoupled initiator that runs without yielding. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">e) While an initiator is running without interacting with any other components and without yielding, any valid DMI region will remain valid. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">f) It is possible that after a temporally decoupled initiator using DMI has yielded, another temporally decoupled initiator may cause that same DMI region to be invalidated within the current time quantum. This reflects the fundamental inaccuracy intrinsic to temporal decoupling in general, but does not represent a violation of the rules given in this clause. </SPAN></P>
