<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">Temporal decoupling permits SystemC processes to run ahead of simulation time for an amount of time known as the time quantum, and is associated with the loosely-timed coding style. Temporal decoupling permits a significant simulation speed improvement by reducing the number of context switches and events. The use of a time quantum is not strictly necessary in the presence of explicit synchronization between temporally decoupled processes, in which case processes may run arbitrarily far ahead to the point when the next synchronization point is reached. However, any processes that do require a time quantum should use the global quantum. </SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">When using temporal decoupling, the delays annotated to the <B>b_transport </B>and <I>nb_transport </I>methods are to be interpreted as local time offsets defined relative to the current simulation time as returned by <B>sc_time_stamp()</B>, also known as the quantum boundary. The global quantum is the default time interval between successive quantum boundaries. The value of the global time quantum is maintained by the singleton class <B>tlm_global_quantum</B>. It is recommended that each process should use the global time quantum, but a process is permitted to calculate its own local time quantum. </SPAN></P>
