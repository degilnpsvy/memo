Every item in a plain list59 (see Plain lists) can be made into a checkbox by starting it with the string &#8216;[ ]&#8217;. This feature is similar to TODO items (see TODO Items), but is more lightweight. Checkboxes are not included in the global TODO list, so they are often great to split a task into a number of simple steps. Or you can use them in a shopping list. To toggle a checkbox, use <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, or use the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's org-mouse.el).
