<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">Depending on the protocol, an initiator or a target may return TLM_COMPLETED from <I>nb_transport </I>at any point in order to complete the transaction early. Neither initiator nor target may make any further <I>nb_transport </I>calls for this particular transaction instance. Whether or not an initiator or target is actually permitted to shortcut a transaction in this way depends on the rules of the specific protocol. In the diagram below, the timing annotation on the return path indicates to the initiator that the final timing point is to occur after the given delay. The phase transitions from BEGIN_REQ through END_REQ and BEGIN_RESP to END_RESP are implicit, rather than being passed explicitly as arguments to nb_transport.</SPAN>
