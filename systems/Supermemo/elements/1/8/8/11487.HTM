<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">If the recipient of an <I>nb_transport </I>call can immediately calculate the next state of the transaction and the delay to the next timing point, it may return the new state on return from <I>nb_transport </I>rather than using the opposite path. If the next timing point marks the end of the transaction, the recipient can return either TLM_UPDATED or TLM_COMPLETED. A callee can return TLM_COMPLETED at any stage (subject to the rules of the protocol) to indicate to the caller that it has pre-empted the other phases and jumped to the final phase, completing the transaction. This applies to initiator and target alike. With TLM_UPDATED, the callee should update the transaction, the phase, and the timing annotation. In the diagram below, the non-zero timing annotation argument passed on return from the function calls indicates to the caller the delay between the phase transition on the hop and the corresponding timing point.</SPAN>
