3&nbsp;Using multiple images
<P></P>
<P>QEMU can utilise up to four image files to present multiple virtual drives to the guest system. This can be quite useful, as in the following examples:</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a pagefile or swapfile virtual disc that can be shared between QEMU guests<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a common data drive where all data is stored, accessible from each QEMU guest but isolated from the host<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giving additional space to a QEMU guest without reconfiguring the primary image<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separating competing I/O operations onto different physical drive spindles by placing the separate QEMU images on different physical drives<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emulating a multi-drive physical environment for testing / learning</P>
<P>Bear in mind that only one instance of QEMU may access an image at a time - shared doesn't mean shared simultaneously!</P>
<P>To utilise additional images in QEMU, specify them on the command line with options -hda, -hdb, -hdc, -hdd.</P>
<P>qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -hdb pagefile.img -hdc testdata.img -hdd tempfiles.img -kernel-kqemu</P>
<P>NB: QEMU doesn't support both -hdc and -cdrom at the same time, as they both represent the first device on the second IDE channel.
