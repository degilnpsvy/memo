<P>Once QEMU has been installed, and kqemu compiled and configured, it should be ready to run a guest OS from a virtual disc image. A disc image is a file that represents the data on a hard disc. From the perspective of the guest OS, it actually is a hard disc, and the guest OS can actually create its own filesystem on the virtual disc.</P>
<P>You can download a few guest OS images from the QEMU website, including a simple 8MB image of a Linux distro. To run it, download and unzip the image in a folder and run the QEMU command.</P>
<P>qemu linux-0.2.img</P>
<P>Replace linux-0.2.img with the name of your guest OS image file. If it has a GUI and you want to use your mouse with it, double-click on the window and QEMU will grab your mouse. To make QEMU release your mouse again, hold down the Control and Alt keys simultaneously, then let go - your mouse will be released back to X.<BR>Contents<BR>[hide]</P>
