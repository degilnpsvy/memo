1&nbsp;Image types
<P></P>
<P>QEMU supports several image types. The "native" and most flexible type is qcow2, which supports copy on write, encryption, compression, and VM snapshots.</P>
<P>If you need to copy files to and from the image directly from the host, however, you need to use the raw image type.</P>
<P>QEMU currently supports these image types or formats:</P>
<P>raw <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (default) the raw format is a plain binary image of the disc image, and is very portable. On filesystems that support sparse files, images in this format only use the space actually used by the data recorded in them.<BR>cloop <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compressed Loop format, mainly used for reading Knoppix and similar live CD image formats<BR>cow <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy-on-write format, supported for historical reasons only and not available to QEMU on Windows<BR>qcow <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old QEMU copy-on-write format, supported for historical reasons and superseded by qcow2<BR>qcow2 <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QEMU copy-on-write format with a range of special features, including the ability to take multiple snapshots, smaller images on filesystems that don't support sparse files, optional AES encryption, and optional zlib compression<BR>vmdk <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VMware 3 &amp; 4, or 6 image format, for exchanging images with that product
