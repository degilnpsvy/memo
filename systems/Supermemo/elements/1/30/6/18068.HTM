2&nbsp;Creating an image
<P></P>
<P>To set up your own guest OS image, you first need to create a blank disc image. QEMU has the qemu-img command for creating and manipulating disc images, and supports a variety of formats. If you don't tell it what format to use, it will use raw files. The "native" format for QEMU is qcow2, and this format offers some flexibility. Here we'll create a 3GB qcow2 image to install Windows XP on:</P>
<P>qemu-img create -f qcow2 winxp.img 3GB</P>
<P>The easiest way to install a guest OS is to create an ISO image of a boot CD/DVD and tell QEMU to boot off it. Many free operating systems can be downloaded from the Internet as bootable ISO images, and you can use them directly without having to burn them to disc.</P>
<P>Here we'll boot off an ISO image of a properly licensed Windows XP boot disc. We'll also give it 256MB of RAM, but we won't use the kqemu kernel module just yet because it causes problems during Windows XP installation.</P>
<P>qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom winxpsp2.iso -boot d</P>
<P>To boot from a real CD or DVD, tell QEMU where to find it. On Linux systems, you can usually use a logical device name like /dev/cdrom or /dev/dvd, or the physical name of the device, e.g. /dev/sr0</P>
<P>qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom /dev/cdrom -boot d</P>
<P>QEMU will boot from the ISO image or CD/DVD and run the install program. If you have two screens, move the QEMU screen off to the spare one where you can keep an eye on the installer, but get on with something else - it will take a while!</P>
<P>Once the guest OS has installed successfully, you can shutdown the guest OS (e.g. in Windows XP, click on Start and then Shutdown). Once it has shutdown, start QEMU up with the kqemu kernel module to give it a little more speed.</P>
<P>qemu -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom winxpsp2.iso -kernel-kqemu</P>
<P>If you are running an x86-64 Linux (i.e. 64-bit), you will need to run the x86-64 version of QEMU to be able to utilise kqemu:</P>
<P>qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256 -hda winxp.img -cdrom winxpsp2.iso -kernel-kqemu
