5&nbsp;Mounting an image on the host
<P></P>
<P>Sometimes it is helpful to be able to mount a drive image under the host system. For example, if the guest doesn't have network support, the only way to transfer files into and out of the guest will be by the storage devices it can address.</P>
<P>Linux and other Unix-like hosts can mount images created with the raw format type using a loopback device. From a root login (or using sudo), mount a loopback with an offset of 32,256.</P>
<P>mount -o loop,offset=32256 /path/to/image.img /mnt/mountpoint</P>
<P>For example, to copy some files across to a FreeDOS hard drive image:</P>
<P>mkdir -p /mnt/freedos<BR>mount -o loop,offset=32256 freedos-c.img /mnt/freedos<BR>cp oldgames /mnt/freedos<BR>umount /mnt/freedos</P>
<P>NB: never mount a QEMU image while QEMU is using it, or you are likely to corrupt the filesystem on the image.</P>
<P>Note: if you have an image without partitions you should omit the ,offset=32256 part. This is for instance the case if you want to mount linux-0.2.img (which can be found at the qemu web site at the time of writing)
