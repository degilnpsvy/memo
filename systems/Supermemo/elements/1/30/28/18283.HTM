The idea is that a program should join only with the threads that it &#8220;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8221; about. The problem with a &#8220;join with any thread&#8221; operation stems from the fact that there is no hierarchy of threads, so such an operation could indeed join with any thread, including one that was privately created by a library function. (The condition-variable technique that we show in Section 30.2.4 allows a thread to join only with any other thread that it knows about.) As a consequence, the library would no longer be able to join with that thread in order to obtain its status, and it would erroneously try to join with a thread ID that had already been joined. In other words, a &#8220;join with any thread&#8221; operation is incompatible with modular program design.</EM></FONT></SPAN>
