Well, ncurses uses the ordinary text mode. The console is a N&#215;M grid of characters and attributes (color, background, blink). Good old VGA directly supports this, i.e. by writing the right values at the right place of memory a VGA compliant graphics card will draw the text according to this. Where VGA is not available, the Linux kernel can emulate this through the raw framebuffer memory device (/dev/fbdev). But text mode can't do any kind of fancy graphics.
