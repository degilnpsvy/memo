<FONT class=extract>Memory is accessed by the 80x86 processors using segments and offsets.</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P>Segments tell the memory management unit where in memory is located, and the offset is the displacement from that address. In real mode offsets are limited to 64K, because of the 16-bit nature of the 8086. 
<P>In protected mode, segments can be any size up to the full address capability of the machine. Segments are accessed via special segment registers in the processor. 
<P>In real mode, the segment address is shifted left four bits and added to the offset, allowing for a 20 bit address (20 bits = 1 MB); in protected mode segments are offsets into a table in memory which tells where the segment is located. Your particular programming environment may create code for real and/or protected mode, and it is important to know which mode is being used.
