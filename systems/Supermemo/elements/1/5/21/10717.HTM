Ordered list items start with a numeral followed by either a period or a right parenthesis15, such as &#8216;1.&#8217; or &#8216;1)&#8217;16. If you want a list to start with a different value (e.g., 20), start the text of the item with [@20]17. Those constructs can be used in any item of the list in order to enforce a particular numbering.&nbsp;
