<P class=docText>The final feature we'll cover is <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-e</SPAN>, (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-expand</SPAN>). Like the conditional compilation motion commands (e.g., <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-u</SPAN> for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-up-conditional</SPAN>), <SPAN class=docEmphBold>c-macro-expand</SPAN> helps you answer the often difficult question, "What code actually gets compiled?" when your source code contains a morass of preprocessor directives.
