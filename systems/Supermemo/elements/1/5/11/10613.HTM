<H2 id=sec-1>What is Getting Things Done</H2>
<DIV id=text-1>
<P>"Getting Things Done" is a book by<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen</A><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>in which he describes a work-life management system developed after twenty years of consulting work. The promise of GTD is "Stress-free productivity" and developing a calm state of mind in a state of readiness. Allen's second book, "Ready for Anything" elaborates on these principles in a series of essays.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of GTD lies in taking a complete and current inventory of all your commitments, then organizing and reviewing this information regularly in a systematic way. Your work and life can then be viewed from different levels of detail allowing you to make choices about what to do (and not do) at any moment.</P>
<P>The GTD system has some key practices that make it efficient and effective:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Everything that has your attention and requires action is captured in your<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>system</B>, including physical objects (or representations), paper, email messages, mail, and notes. 
<LI>A set of<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>collection buckets</B><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>to capture all your stuff and commitments, for example, my intray, email program, voice mail and notebooks. 
<LI>A<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>workflow</B><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>for processing the "stuff" you collect on a regular basis. This processing usually occurs daily. 
<LI><B>Next Action</B><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>steps are defined with a clear outcome and action verb to make it easy to perform the work. For example, "Send report to John". 
<LI><B>Organizing</B><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>reminders and information in appropriate<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>categories</B><SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN>and structures based on how and when you need them. This includes calendars with reminder system, "tickler" files, and filing systems. 
<LI>Keeping current with your commitments and actions with appropriate daily and weekly<SPAN class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>reviews</B>. In addition, your commitments are reviewed at different levels ("altitudes") giving you higher and longer-term perspectives on your life. 
<LI>A Natural Planning model for defining and actioning projects.</LI></UL>
<P>The benefit I have gained from using GTD is confidence that I haven't forgotten to do something because I regularly capture my thoughts, commitments, ideas and "to do" items in a trusted system. This allows me to think more clearly and not be stressed worrying about what I may have forgotten.</P></DIV></DIV>
