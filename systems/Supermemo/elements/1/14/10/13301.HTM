<P><FONT class=extract>When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right. </FONT></P>
<OL>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html#Shell-Expansions"><FONT class=extract>Shell Expansions</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>). If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining words are the arguments. </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract>Redirections are performed as described above (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html#Redirections"><FONT class=extract>Redirections</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>). </FONT>
<LI><FONT class=extract>The text after the &#8216;<SAMP>=</SAMP>&#8217; in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned to the variable. </FONT></LI></OL>
<P><FONT class=extract>If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment. Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the current shell environment. If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero status. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environment. A redirection error causes the command to exit with a non-zero status. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described below. Otherwise, the command exits. If one of the expansions contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed. If there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.</FONT> </P>
