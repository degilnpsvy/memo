<P><FONT class=extract>When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the <VAR>environment</VAR>. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form <CODE>name=value</CODE>.</FONT> </P>
<P>Bash provides several ways to manipulate the environment. On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for <VAR>export</VAR> to child processes. Executed commands inherit the environment. <FONT class=extract>The <CODE>export</CODE> and &#8216;<SAMP>declare -x</SAMP>&#8217; commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment.</FONT> If the value of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the old. <FONT class=extract>The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the shell&#8217;s initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the <CODE>unset</CODE> and &#8216;<SAMP>export -n</SAMP>&#8217; commands, plus any additions via the <CODE>export</CODE> and &#8216;<SAMP>declare -x</SAMP>&#8217; commands.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The environment for any simple command or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described in </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameters.html#Shell-Parameters"><FONT class=extract>Shell Parameters</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If the <SAMP>-k</SAMP> option is set (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin"><FONT class=extract>The Set Builtin</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), then all parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>When Bash invokes an external command, the variable &#8216;<SAMP>$_</SAMP>&#8217; is set to the full path name of the command and passed to that command in its environment.</FONT>
