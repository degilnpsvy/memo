<P>The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent keystrokes. </P>
<P>The text <KBD><EM>C-k</EM></KBD> is read as &#8216;Control-K&#8217; and describes the character produced when the <TT class=key>k</TT> key is pressed while the Control key is depressed. </P>
<P>The text <KBD><EM>M-k</EM></KBD> is read as &#8216;Meta-K&#8217; and describes the character produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <TT class=key>k</TT> key is pressed. The Meta key is labeled <TT class=key>ALT</TT> on many keyboards. On keyboards with two keys labeled <TT class=key>ALT</TT> (usually to either side of the space bar), the <TT class=key>ALT</TT> on the left side is generally set to work as a Meta key. The <TT class=key>ALT</TT> key on the right may also be configured to work as a Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a Compose key for typing accented characters. </P>
<P>If you do not have a Meta or <TT class=key>ALT</TT> key, or another key working as a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <TT class=key>ESC</TT> <EM>first</EM>, and then typing <TT class=key>k</TT>. Either process is known as <EM>metafying</EM> the <TT class=key>k</TT> key. </P>
<P>The text <KBD><EM>M-C-k</EM></KBD> is read as &#8216;Meta-Control-k&#8217; and describes the character produced by <EM>metafying</EM> <KBD><EM>C-k</EM></KBD>. </P>
<P>In addition, several keys have their own names. Specifically, <TT class=key>DEL</TT>, <TT class=key>ESC</TT>, <TT class=key>LFD</TT>, <TT class=key>SPC</TT>, <TT class=key>RET</TT>, and <TT class=key>TAB</TT> all stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Readline-Init-File.html#Readline-Init-File">Readline Init File</A>). If your keyboard lacks a <TT class=key>LFD</TT> key, typing <TT class=key>C-j</TT> will produce the desired character. The <TT class=key>RET</TT> key may be labeled <TT class=key>Return</TT> or <TT class=key>Enter</TT> on some keyboards. </P>
