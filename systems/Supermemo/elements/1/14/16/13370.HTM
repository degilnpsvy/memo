<P>These are installation instructions for Bash. </P>
<P>The simplest way to compile Bash is: </P>
<OL>
<LI><CODE>cd</CODE> to the directory containing the source code and type &#8216;<SAMP>./configure</SAMP>&#8217; to configure Bash for your system. If you&#8217;re using <CODE>csh</CODE> on an old version of System V, you might need to type &#8216;<SAMP>sh ./configure</SAMP>&#8217; instead to prevent <CODE>csh</CODE> from trying to execute <CODE>configure</CODE> itself. 
<P>Running <CODE>configure</CODE> takes some time. While running, it prints messages telling which features it is checking for. </P>
<LI>Type &#8216;<SAMP>make</SAMP>&#8217; to compile Bash and build the <CODE>bashbug</CODE> bug reporting script. 
<LI>Optionally, type &#8216;<SAMP>make tests</SAMP>&#8217; to run the Bash test suite. 
<LI>Type &#8216;<SAMP>make install</SAMP>&#8217; to install <CODE>bash</CODE> and <CODE>bashbug</CODE>. This will also install the manual pages and Info file. </LI></OL>
<P>The <CODE>configure</CODE> shell script attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values to create a <SAMP>Makefile</SAMP> in each directory of the package (the top directory, the <SAMP>builtins</SAMP>, <SAMP>doc</SAMP>, and <SAMP>support</SAMP> directories, each directory under <SAMP>lib</SAMP>, and several others). It also creates a <SAMP>config.h</SAMP> file containing system-dependent definitions. Finally, it creates a shell script named <CODE>config.status</CODE> that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file <SAMP>config.cache</SAMP> that saves the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file <SAMP>config.log</SAMP> containing compiler output (useful mainly for debugging <CODE>configure</CODE>). If at some point <SAMP>config.cache</SAMP> contains results you don&#8217;t want to keep, you may remove or edit it. </P>
<P>To find out more about the options and arguments that the <CODE>configure</CODE> script understands, type </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>bash-2.04$ ./configure --help
</PRE></DIV>
<P>at the Bash prompt in your Bash source directory. </P>
<P>If you need to do unusual things to compile Bash, please try to figure out how <CODE>configure</CODE> could check whether or not to do them, and mail diffs or instructions to <A href="mailto:bash-maintainers@gnu.org">bash-maintainers@gnu.org</A> so they can be considered for the next release. </P>
<P>The file <SAMP>configure.in</SAMP> is used to create <CODE>configure</CODE> by a program called Autoconf. You only need <SAMP>configure.in</SAMP> if you want to change it or regenerate <CODE>configure</CODE> using a newer version of Autoconf. If you do this, make sure you are using Autoconf version 2.50 or newer. </P>
<P>You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source code directory by typing &#8216;<SAMP>make clean</SAMP>&#8217;. To also remove the files that <CODE>configure</CODE> created (so you can compile Bash for a different kind of computer), type &#8216;<SAMP>make distclean</SAMP>&#8217;. </P>
