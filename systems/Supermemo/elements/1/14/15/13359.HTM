<H3 class=section>8.5 Readline vi Mode</H3>
<P>While the Readline library does not have a full set of <CODE>vi</CODE> editing functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing of the line. The Readline <CODE>vi</CODE> mode behaves as specified in the <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> standard. </P>
<P>In order to switch interactively between <CODE>emacs</CODE> and <CODE>vi</CODE> editing modes, use the &#8216;<SAMP>set -o emacs</SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP>set -o vi</SAMP>&#8217; commands (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin">The Set Builtin</A>). The Readline default is <CODE>emacs</CODE> mode. </P>
<P>When you enter a line in <CODE>vi</CODE> mode, you are already placed in &#8216;insertion&#8217; mode, as if you had typed an &#8216;<SAMP>i</SAMP>&#8217;. Pressing <TT class=key>ESC</TT> switches you into &#8216;command&#8217; mode, where you can edit the text of the line with the standard <CODE>vi</CODE> movement keys, move to previous history lines with &#8216;<SAMP>k</SAMP>&#8217; and subsequent lines with &#8216;<SAMP>j</SAMP>&#8217;, and so forth.
