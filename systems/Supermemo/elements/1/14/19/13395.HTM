If you set a bookmark, Emacs saves the bookmarks file automatically (and in fact without asking). If you set an annotation but do not add or move a bookmark during the session, you must save the bookmarks file manually by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>M-x bookmark-save</FONT></SPAN>.
