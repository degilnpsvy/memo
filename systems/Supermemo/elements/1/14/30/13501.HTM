The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, unless the <CODE>pipefail</CODE> option is enabled (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin">The Set Builtin</A>). If <CODE>pipefail</CODE> is enabled, the pipeline&#8217;s return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. If the reserved word &#8216;<SAMP>!</SAMP>&#8217; precedes the pipeline, the exit status is the logical negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.
