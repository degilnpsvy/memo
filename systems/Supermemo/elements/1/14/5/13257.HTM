<P><FONT class=extract>A non-quoted backslash &#8216;<SAMP>\</SAMP>&#8217; is the Bash escape character.</FONT> It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of <CODE>newline</CODE>. <FONT class=extract>If a <CODE>\newline</CODE> pair appears, and the backslash itself is not quoted, the <CODE>\newline</CODE> is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).</FONT>
