<P><FONT class=extract>Enclosing characters in double quotes (&#8216;<SAMP>"</SAMP>&#8217;) preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>`</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>\</SAMP>&#8217;, and, when history expansion is enabled, &#8216;<SAMP>!</SAMP>&#8217;.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The characters &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP>`</SAMP>&#8217; retain their special meaning within double quotes (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html#Shell-Expansions"><FONT class=extract>Shell Expansions</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>).</FONT> <FONT class=extract>The backslash retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>`</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>"</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>\</SAMP>&#8217;, or <CODE>newline</CODE>.</FONT> Within double quotes, backslashes that are followed by one of these characters are removed. Backslashes preceding characters without a special meaning are left unmodified. A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash. If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an &#8216;<SAMP>!</SAMP>&#8217; appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash. <FONT class=extract>The backslash preceding the &#8216;<SAMP>!</SAMP>&#8217; is not removed.</FONT> </P>
<P>The special parameters &#8216;<SAMP>*</SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP>@</SAMP>&#8217; have special meaning when in double quotes (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion">Shell Parameter Expansion</A>).
