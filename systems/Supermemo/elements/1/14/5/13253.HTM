<H3 class=section>1.1 What is Bash?</H3>
<P>Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the <SMALL><FONT size=2>GNU</FONT></SMALL> operating system. The name is an acronym for the &#8216;<SAMP>Bourne-Again SHell</SAMP>&#8217;, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell <CODE>sh</CODE>, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix. </P>
<P>Bash is largely compatible with <CODE>sh</CODE> and incorporates useful features from the Korn shell <CODE>ksh</CODE> and the C shell <CODE>csh</CODE>. It is intended to be a conformant implementation of the <SMALL><FONT size=2>IEEE</FONT></SMALL> <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> Shell and Tools portion of the <SMALL><FONT size=2>IEEE</FONT></SMALL> <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> specification (<SMALL><FONT size=2>IEEE</FONT></SMALL> Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over <CODE>sh</CODE> for both interactive and programming use. </P>
<P>While the <SMALL><FONT size=2>GNU</FONT></SMALL> operating system provides other shells, including a version of <CODE>csh</CODE>, Bash is the default shell. Like other <SMALL><FONT size=2>GNU</FONT></SMALL> software, Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports exist for <SMALL><FONT size=2>MS-DOS</FONT></SMALL>, <SMALL><FONT size=2>OS/2</FONT></SMALL>, and Windows platforms.
