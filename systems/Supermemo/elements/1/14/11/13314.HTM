<H3 class=section>4.4 Special Builtins</H3><A name=index-special-builtin-1></A>
<P>For historical reasons, the <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> standard has classified several builtin commands as <EM>special</EM>. When Bash is executing in <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> mode, the special builtins differ from other builtin commands in three respects: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Special builtins are found before shell functions during command lookup. 
<LI>If a special builtin returns an error status, a non-interactive shell exits. 
<LI>Assignment statements preceding the command stay in effect in the shell environment after the command completes. </LI></OL>
<P>When Bash is not executing in <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> mode, these builtins behave no differently than the rest of the Bash builtin commands. The Bash <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> mode is described in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-POSIX-Mode.html#Bash-POSIX-Mode">Bash POSIX Mode</A>. </P>
<P>These are the <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> special builtins: </P>
