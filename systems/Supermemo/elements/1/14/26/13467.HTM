If the builtin command <CODE>return</CODE> is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call. <FONT class=extract>Any command associated with the <CODE>RETURN</CODE> trap is executed before execution resumes.</FONT> When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter &#8216;<SAMP>#</SAMP>&#8217; are restored to the values they had prior to the function&#8217;s execution. If a numeric argument is given to <CODE>return</CODE>, that is the function&#8217;s return status; otherwise the function&#8217;s return status is the exit status of the last command executed before the <CODE>return</CODE>.
