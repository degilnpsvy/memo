All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions: </P>
<P>the <CODE>DEBUG</CODE> and <CODE>RETURN</CODE> traps are not inherited unless the function has been given the <CODE>trace</CODE> attribute using the <CODE>declare</CODE> builtin or the <CODE>-o functrace</CODE> option has been enabled with the <CODE>set</CODE> builtin, (in which case all functions inherit the <CODE>DEBUG</CODE> and <CODE>RETURN</CODE> traps), </P>
<P>and the <CODE>ERR</CODE> trap is not inherited unless the <CODE>-o errtrace</CODE> shell option has been enabled. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#Bourne-Shell-Builtins">Bourne Shell Builtins</A>, for the description of the <CODE>trap</CODE> builtin.
