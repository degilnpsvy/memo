<P><FONT class=extract>Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. This mechanism is similar to <VAR>filename expansion</VAR> (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion"><FONT class=extract>Filename Expansion</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), but the file names generated need not exist. Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional <VAR>preamble</VAR>, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a seqeunce expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional <VAR>postscript</VAR>. The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right. </FONT></P>
<P>Brace expansions may be nested. The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved. For example, </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>bash$ echo a{d,c,b}e
ade ace abe
</PRE></DIV>
<P><FONT class=extract>A sequence expression takes the form <CODE>{<VAR>x</VAR>..<VAR>y</VAR>[..<VAR>incr</VAR>]}</CODE>, where <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> are either integers or single characters, and <VAR>incr</VAR>, an optional increment, is an integer. When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each number between <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>, inclusive. Supplied integers may be prefixed with &#8216;<SAMP>0</SAMP>&#8217; to force each term to have the same width. When either <VAR>x</VAR> or <VAR>y</VAR> begins with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary. When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexicographically between <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR>, inclusive. Note that both <VAR>x</VAR> and <VAR>y</VAR> must be of the same type. When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between each term. The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. It is strictly textual. Bash does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string &#8216;<SAMP>${</SAMP>&#8217; is not considered eligible for brace expansion. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression. Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A { or &#8216;<SAMP>,</SAMP>&#8217; may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression. To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string &#8216;<SAMP>${</SAMP>&#8217; is not considered eligible for brace expansion.</FONT> </P>
<P>This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example: </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
</PRE></DIV>
<P>or </P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example>chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}
</PRE></DIV>
