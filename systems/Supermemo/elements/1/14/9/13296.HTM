<H4 class=subsection>3.6.6 Here Documents</H4>
<P><FONT class=extract>This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only <VAR>word</VAR> (with no trailing blanks) is seen. All of the lines read up to that point are then used as the standard input for a command. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The format of here-documents is: </FONT></P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>&lt;&lt;[-]<VAR>word</VAR>
        <VAR>here-document</VAR>
<VAR>delimiter</VAR>
</FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P><FONT class=extract>No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or filename expansion is performed on <VAR>word</VAR>. If any characters in <VAR>word</VAR> are quoted, the <VAR>delimiter</VAR> is the result of quote removal on <VAR>word</VAR>, and the lines in the here-document are not expanded. If <VAR>word</VAR> is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In the latter case, the character sequence <CODE>\newline</CODE> is ignored, and &#8216;<SAMP>\</SAMP>&#8217; must be used to quote the characters &#8216;<SAMP>\</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217;, and &#8216;<SAMP>`</SAMP>&#8217;. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>If the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&lt;&lt;-</SAMP>&#8217;, then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing <VAR>delimiter</VAR>. This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion.</FONT>
