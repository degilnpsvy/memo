<H4 class=subsection>3.6.2 Redirecting Output</H4>
<P>Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from the expansion of <VAR>word</VAR> to be opened for writing on file descriptor <VAR>n</VAR>, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if <VAR>n</VAR> is not specified. If the file does not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero size. </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The general format for redirecting output is: </FONT></P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>[<VAR>n</VAR>]&gt;[|]<VAR>word</VAR>
</FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P><FONT class=extract>If the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217;, and the <CODE>noclobber</CODE> option to the <CODE>set</CODE> builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of <VAR>word</VAR> exists and is a regular file. If the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;|</SAMP>&#8217;, or the redirection operator is &#8216;<SAMP>&gt;</SAMP>&#8217; and the <CODE>noclobber</CODE> option is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even if the file named by <VAR>word</VAR> exists.</FONT>
