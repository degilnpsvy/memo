Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (<EM>builtins</EM>) implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via separate utilities. For example, <CODE>cd</CODE>, <CODE>break</CODE>, <CODE>continue</CODE>, and <CODE>exec</CODE>) cannot be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate the shell itself. The <CODE>history</CODE>, <CODE>getopts</CODE>, <CODE>kill</CODE>, or <CODE>pwd</CODE> builtins, among others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more convenient to use as builtin commands. All of the shell builtins are described in subsequent sections.
