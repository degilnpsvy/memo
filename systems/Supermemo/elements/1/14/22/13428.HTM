What if I want the standard error of <VAR>command1</VAR> is connected to <VAR>command2</VAR>&#8217;s standard input through the pipe?

<P><FONT class=clozed>If &#8216;<SAMP>|&amp;</SAMP>&#8217; is used, the standard error of <VAR>command1</VAR> is connected to <VAR>command2</VAR>&#8217;s standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for <CODE>2&gt;&amp;1 |</CODE>. This implicit redirection of the standard error is performed after any redirections specified by the command.</FONT>
