The exit status of a pipeline is the exit status of <FONT class=clozed>the last command in the pipeline</FONT>, unless <FONT class=clozed>the <CODE>pipefail</CODE> option is enabled (see </FONT><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin"><FONT class=clozed>The Set Builtin</FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>). If <CODE>pipefail</CODE> is enabled, the pipeline&#8217;s return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.</FONT> If <FONT class=clozed>the reserved word &#8216;<SAMP>!</SAMP>&#8217; precedes the pipeline</FONT>, the exit status is the logical negation of the exit status as described above. The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.
