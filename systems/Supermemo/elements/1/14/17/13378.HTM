<H2 class=appendix>Appendix A Reporting Bugs</H2>
<P>Please report all bugs you find in Bash. But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of Bash. The latest version of Bash is always available for FTP from <A href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/</A>. </P>
<P>Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the <CODE>bashbug</CODE> command to submit a bug report. If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well! Suggestions and &#8216;philosophical&#8217; bug reports may be mailed to <A href="mailto:bug-bash@gnu.org">bug-bash@gnu.org</A> or posted to the Usenet newsgroup <CODE>gnu.bash.bug</CODE>. </P>
<P>All bug reports should include: </P>
<UL>
<LI>The version number of Bash. 
<LI>The hardware and operating system. 
<LI>The compiler used to compile Bash. 
<LI>A description of the bug behaviour. 
<LI>A short script or &#8216;recipe&#8217; which exercises the bug and may be used to reproduce it. </LI></UL>
<P><CODE>bashbug</CODE> inserts the first three items automatically into the template it provides for filing a bug report. </P>
<P>Please send all reports concerning this manual to <A href="mailto:chet.ramey@case.edu">chet.ramey@case.edu</A>.
