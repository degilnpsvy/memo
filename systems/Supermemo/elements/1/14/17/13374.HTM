<H3 class=section>10.5 Specifying the System Type</H3>
<P>There may be some features <CODE>configure</CODE> can not figure out automatically, but need to determine by the type of host Bash will run on. Usually <CODE>configure</CODE> can figure that out, but if it prints a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the <SAMP>--host=TYPE</SAMP> option. &#8216;<SAMP>TYPE</SAMP>&#8217; can either be a short name for the system type, such as &#8216;<SAMP>sun4</SAMP>&#8217;, or a canonical name with three fields: &#8216;<SAMP>CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM</SAMP>&#8217; (e.g., &#8216;<SAMP>i386-unknown-freebsd4.2</SAMP>&#8217;). </P>
<P>See the file <SAMP>support/config.sub</SAMP> for the possible values of each field.
