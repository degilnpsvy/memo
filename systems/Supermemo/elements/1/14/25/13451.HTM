The braces are <CODE>reserved words</CODE>, so they must be separated from the <VAR>list</VAR> by <CODE>blank</CODE>s or other shell metacharacters. The parentheses are <CODE>operators</CODE>, and are recognized as separate tokens by the shell even if they are not separated from the <VAR>list</VAR> by whitespace.
