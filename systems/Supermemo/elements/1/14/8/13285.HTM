<H4 class=subsection>3.5.7 Word Splitting</H4><A name=index-word-splitting></A>
<P>The shell scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double quotes for word splitting. </P>
<P>The shell treats each character of <CODE>$IFS</CODE> as a delimiter, and splits the results of the other expansions into words on these characters. If <CODE>IFS</CODE> is unset, or its value is exactly <CODE>&lt;space&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;newline&gt;</CODE>, the default, then sequences of <CODE>&lt;space&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE>, and <CODE>&lt;newline&gt;</CODE> at the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and any sequence of <CODE>IFS</CODE> characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words. If <CODE>IFS</CODE> has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters <CODE>space</CODE> and <CODE>tab</CODE> are ignored at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of <CODE>IFS</CODE> (an <CODE>IFS</CODE> whitespace character). Any character in <CODE>IFS</CODE> that is not <CODE>IFS</CODE> whitespace, along with any adjacent <CODE>IFS</CODE> whitespace characters, delimits a field. A sequence of <CODE>IFS</CODE> whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter. If the value of <CODE>IFS</CODE> is null, no word splitting occurs. </P>
<P>Explicit null arguments (<CODE>""</CODE> or <CODE>''</CODE>) are retained. Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed. If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained. </P>
<P>Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.
