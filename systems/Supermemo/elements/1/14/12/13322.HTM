<H4 class=subsection>6.3.1 What is an Interactive Shell?</H4>
<P>An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments, unless <SAMP>-s</SAMP> is specified, without specifying the <SAMP>-c</SAMP> option, and whose input and error output are both connected to terminals (as determined by <CODE>isatty(3)</CODE>), or one started with the <SAMP>-i</SAMP> option. </P>
<P>An interactive shell generally reads from and writes to a user&#8217;s terminal. </P>
<P>The <SAMP>-s</SAMP> invocation option may be used to set the positional parameters when an interactive shell is started.
