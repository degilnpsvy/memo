The reserved word <CODE>time</CODE> causes timing statistics to be printed for the pipeline once it finishes. The statistics currently consist of elapsed (wall-clock) time and user and system time consumed by the command&#8217;s execution. The <SAMP>-p</SAMP> option changes the output format to that specified by <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL>. When the shell is in <SMALL><FONT size=2>POSIX</FONT></SMALL> mode (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-POSIX-Mode.html#Bash-POSIX-Mode">Bash POSIX Mode</A>), it does not recognize <CODE>time</CODE> as a reserved word if the next token begins with a &#8216;<SAMP>-</SAMP>&#8217;. The <CODE>TIMEFORMAT</CODE> variable may be set to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed. See <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Variables.html#Bash-Variables">Bash Variables</A>, for a description of the available formats. The use of <CODE>time</CODE> as a reserved word permits the timing of shell builtins, shell functions, and pipelines. An external <CODE>time</CODE> command cannot time these easily.
