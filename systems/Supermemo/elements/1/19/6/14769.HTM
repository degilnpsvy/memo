In make, the first argument of the <CODE>if</CODE> function, <VAR>condition</VAR>, first has all preceding and trailing whitespace stripped, then is expanded. If it expands to <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, then the condition is considered to be true. If it expands to <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, the condition is considered to be false.
