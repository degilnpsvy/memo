Implicit Rule Search Algorithm 
<P></P>
<OL type=1>
<LI>Split <VAR>t</VAR> into a directory part, called <VAR>d</VAR>, and the rest, called <VAR>n</VAR>. For example, if <VAR>t</VAR> is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>src/foo.o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, then <VAR>d</VAR> is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>src/</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and <VAR>n</VAR> is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. 
<LI>Make a list of all the pattern rules one of whose targets matches <VAR>t</VAR> or <VAR>n</VAR>. If the target pattern contains a slash, it is matched against <VAR>t</VAR>; otherwise, against <VAR>n</VAR>. 
<LI>If any rule in that list is <EM>not</EM> a match-anything rule, then remove all non-terminal match-anything rules from the list. 
<LI>Remove from the list all rules with no recipe. 
<LI>For each pattern rule in the list: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>Find the stem <VAR>s</VAR>, which is the nonempty part of <VAR>t</VAR> or <VAR>n</VAR> matched by the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the target pattern. 
<LI>Compute the prerequisite names by substituting <VAR>s</VAR> for &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; if the target pattern does not contain a slash, append <VAR>d</VAR> to the front of each prerequisite name. 
<LI>Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist. (If a file name is mentioned in the makefile as a target or as an explicit prerequisite, then we say it ought to exist.) 
<P>If all prerequisites exist or ought to exist, or there are no prerequisites, then this rule applies. </P></LI></OL>
<LI>If no pattern rule has been found so far, try harder. For each pattern rule in the list: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>If the rule is terminal, ignore it and go on to the next rule. 
<LI>Compute the prerequisite names as before. 
<LI>Test whether all the prerequisites exist or ought to exist. 
<LI>For each prerequisite that does not exist, follow this algorithm recursively to see if the prerequisite can be made by an implicit rule. 
<LI>If all prerequisites exist, ought to exist, or can be made by implicit rules, then this rule applies. </LI></OL>
<LI>If no implicit rule applies, the rule for <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE>, if any, applies. In that case, give <VAR>t</VAR> the same recipe that <CODE>.DEFAULT</CODE> has. Otherwise, there is no recipe for <VAR>t</VAR>. </LI></OL>
