Here is the procedure <CODE>make</CODE> uses for searching for an implicit rule for a target <VAR>t</VAR>. This procedure is followed for 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>each double-colon rule with no recipe, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>for each target of ordinary rules none of which have a recipe, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>and for each prerequisite that is not the target of any rule. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>It is also followed recursively for prerequisites that come from implicit rules, in the search for a chain of rules.</FONT>
