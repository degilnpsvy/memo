When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various targets, you can define it as a canned sequence with the <CODE><FONT class=clozed>define</FONT></CODE> directive, and refer to the canned sequence from the recipes for those targets. The canned sequence is actually a variable, so the name must not conflict with other variable names.
