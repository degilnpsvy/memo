If you do not use the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--file</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag, the default is to try <FONT class=clozed><SAMP><SPAN class=file>GNUmakefile</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>makefile</SPAN></SAMP>, and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>Makefile</SPAN></SAMP></FONT>, in that order, and use the first of these three which exists or can be made (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefiles">Writing Makefiles</A>).
