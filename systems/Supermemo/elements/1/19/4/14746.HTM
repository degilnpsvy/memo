The variant variables' names are formed by appending &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>D</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>F</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, respectively. These variants are semi-obsolete in GNU <CODE>make</CODE> since the functions <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> can be used to get a similar effect (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#File-Name-Functions">Functions for File Names</A>). Note, however, that the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>D</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; variants all omit the trailing slash which always appears in the output of the <CODE>dir</CODE> function.
