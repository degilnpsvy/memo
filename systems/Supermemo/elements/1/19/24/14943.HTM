Every rule that produces an object file uses the variable <FONT class=clozed><CODE>OUTPUT_OPTION</CODE>. <CODE>make</CODE></FONT> defines this variable either to contain &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-o $@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, or to be empty, depending on a compile-time option. You need the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option to ensure that the output goes into the right file when the source file is in a different directory, as when using <CODE>VPATH</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search">Directory Search</A>).
