When it is time to execute recipes to update a target, they are executed by invoking a new sub-shell for each line of the recipe: 
<P></P>
<P><STRONG>Please note:</STRONG> this implies that <FONT class=extract>setting shell variables and invoking shell commands such as <CODE>cd</CODE> that set a context local to each process will not affect the following lines in the recipe.</FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#fn-2" rel=footnote name=fnd-2><SUP>2</SUP></A> <FONT class=extract>If you want to use <CODE>cd</CODE> to affect the next statement, put both statements in a single recipe line. Then <CODE>make</CODE> will invoke one shell to run the entire line, and the shell will execute the statements in sequence. For example: </FONT></P><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     foo : bar/lose
             cd $(@D) &amp;&amp; gobble $(@F) &gt; ../$@
</FONT></PRE>
<P class=noindent><FONT class=extract>Here we use the shell AND operator (<CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE>) so that if the <CODE>cd</CODE> command fails, the script will fail without trying to invoke the <CODE>gobble</CODE> command in the wrong directory, which could cause problems (in this case it would certainly cause <SAMP><SPAN class=file>../foo</SPAN></SAMP> to be truncated, at least).</FONT>
