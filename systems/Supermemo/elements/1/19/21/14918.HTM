The advantages of shared libraries spring primarily from the fact that when a program is linked against the library, copies of the object modules required by the program are not included in the resulting executable. Instead, the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> merely includes information in the executable file about the shared libraries that are required at run time. When the file is executed, the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> uses this information to load the required shared libraries.
