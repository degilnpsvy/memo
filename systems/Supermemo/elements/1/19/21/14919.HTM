The advantages of shared libraries spring primarily from the fact that when a program is linked against the library, copies of the object modules required by the program are not included in the resulting executable. Instead, the <FONT class=clozed>(static) linker</FONT> merely includes information in the executable file about the shared libraries that are required at run time. When the file is executed, the dynamic linker uses this information to load the required shared libraries.
