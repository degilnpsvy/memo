Unlike normal rules, this does not act as many different rules with the same prerequisites and recipe. If a pattern rule has multiple targets, <CODE>make</CODE> knows that the rule's recipe is responsible for making all of the targets. The recipe is executed only once to make all the targets. When searching for a pattern rule to match a target, the target patterns of a rule other than the one that matches the target in need of a rule are incidental: <CODE>make</CODE> worries only about giving a recipe and prerequisites to the file presently in question. However, when this file's recipe is run, the other targets are marked as having been updated themselves.
