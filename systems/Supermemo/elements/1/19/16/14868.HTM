<FONT class=extract>You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules"><FONT class=extract>Match-Anything Rules</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>).</FONT> This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing special about it is that it will match any target. So such a rule's recipe is used for all targets and prerequisites that have no recipe of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies. 
<P><FONT class=extract>For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source files contain real data, only that they exist. Then you might do this: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=extract>     %::
             touch $@
</FONT></PRE>
<P class=noindent><FONT class=extract>to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created automatically.</FONT>
