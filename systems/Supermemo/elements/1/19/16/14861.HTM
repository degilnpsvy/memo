If there are C compiler options that <EM>must</EM> be used for proper compilation of certain files, do not include them in <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>. Users expect to be able to specify <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> freely themselves. Instead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler independently of <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE>, by writing them explicitly in the compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like this: 
<P></P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>Do include the &#8216;-g&#8217; option in CFLAGS, because that is not required for proper compilation. You can consider it a default that is only recommended. If the package is set up so that it is compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include &#8216;-O&#8217; in the default value of CFLAGS as well.
