When you run <CODE>make</CODE> with the <FONT class=clozed>&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-i</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--ignore-errors</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;</FONT> flag, errors are ignored in all recipes of all rules. A rule in the makefile for the special target <CODE><FONT class=clozed>.IGNORE</FONT></CODE> has the same effect, if there are no prerequisites. These ways of ignoring errors are obsolete because &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is more flexible.
