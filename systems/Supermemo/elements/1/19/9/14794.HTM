The <CODE>foreach</CODE> function has no permanent effect on the variable <VAR>var</VAR>; its value and flavor after the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function call are the same as they were beforehand. The other values which are taken from <VAR>list</VAR> are in effect only temporarily, during the execution of <CODE>foreach</CODE>. The variable <VAR>var</VAR> is a simply-expanded variable during the execution of <CODE>foreach</CODE>. If <VAR>var</VAR> was undefined before the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function call, it is undefined after the call. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>.
