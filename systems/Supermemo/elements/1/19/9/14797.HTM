The <CODE>call</CODE> function expands the <VAR>param</VAR> arguments <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> assigning them to temporary variables. This means that <VAR>variable</VAR> values containing references to built-in functions that have special expansion rules, like <CODE>foreach</CODE> or <CODE>if</CODE>, may not work as you expect.
