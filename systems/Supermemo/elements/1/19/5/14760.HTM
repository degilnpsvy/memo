You may be inclined to define empty recipes for targets that are not actual files, but only exist so that their prerequisites can be remade. However, this is not the best way to do that, because the prerequisites may not be remade properly if the target file actually does exist. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</A>, for a better way to do this.
