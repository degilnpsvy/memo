It is sometimes useful to define recipes which do nothing. This is done simply by giving a recipe that consists of nothing but whitespace. For example: <PRE class=example>     <FONT class=clozed>target: ;
</FONT></PRE>
<P class=noindent>defines an empty recipe for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>target</SPAN></SAMP>. You could also use a line beginning with a recipe prefix character to define an empty recipe, but this would be confusing because such a line looks empty.
