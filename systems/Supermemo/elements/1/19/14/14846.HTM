The first flavor of variable is a <FONT class=clozed><DFN>recursively expanded</DFN> </FONT>variable. Variables of this sort are defined by lines using &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting">Setting Variables</A>) or by the <CODE>define</CODE> directive (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multi_002dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</A>). The value you specify is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables, these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in the course of expanding some other string). When this happens, it is called <DFN>recursive expansion</DFN>.
