<FONT class=clozed>Simply expanded variables</FONT> generally make complicated makefile programming more predictable because they work like variables in most programming languages. They allow you to redefine a variable using its own value (or its value processed in some way by one of the expansion functions) and to use the expansion functions much more efficiently (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Functions">Functions for Transforming Text</A>).
