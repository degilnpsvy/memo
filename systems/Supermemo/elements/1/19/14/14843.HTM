To substitute a variable's value, write <FONT class=clozed>a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable in parentheses or braces: either &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(foo)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>${foo}</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is a valid reference to the variable <CODE>foo</CODE>. This special significance of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is why you must write &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$$</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; to have the effect of a single dollar sign in a file name or recipe.</FONT>
