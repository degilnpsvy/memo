There is another assignment operator for variables, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>?=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. This is called a conditional variable assignment operator, because it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined. This statement: <PRE class=example>     FOO ?= bar
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>is exactly equivalent to this (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-Function">The <CODE>origin</CODE> Function</A>): <PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
       FOO = bar
     endif
</FONT></PRE>
<P>Note that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>?=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will not set that variable.
