An example of appropriate use of&nbsp;MAKECMDGOALS is to avoid including <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.d</SPAN></SAMP> files during <CODE>clean</CODE> rules (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Prerequisites">Automatic Prerequisites</A>), so <CODE>make</CODE> won't create them only to immediately remove them again: <PRE class=example>     sources = foo.c bar.c
     
<FONT class=clozed>     ifneq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),clean)
     include $(sources:.c=.d)
     endif
</FONT></PRE>
