<FONT class=extract>As a special feature, if <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is determined to be a POSIX-style shell, the special prefix characters in &#8220;internal&#8221; recipe lines will <EM>removed</EM> before the recipe is processed. This feature is intended to allow existing makefiles to add the <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE> special target and still run properly without extensive modifications. Since the special prefix characters are not legal at the beginning of a line in a POSIX shell script this is not a loss in functionality.</FONT> For example, this works as expected: <PRE class=example>     .ONESHELL:
     foo : bar/lose
             @cd $(@D)
             @gobble $(@F) &gt; ../$@
</PRE>
<P>Even with this special feature, however, makefiles with <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE> will behave differently in ways that could be noticeable. <FONT class=extract>For example, normally if any line in the recipe fails, that causes the rule to fail and no more recipe lines are processed. Under <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE> a failure of any but the final recipe line will not be noticed by <CODE>make</CODE>. You can modify <CODE>.SHELLFLAGS</CODE> to add the <CODE>-e</CODE> option to the shell which will cause any failure anywhere in the command line to cause the shell to fail, but this could itself cause your recipe to behave differently. Ultimately you may need to harden your recipe lines to allow them to work with <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE>.</FONT>
