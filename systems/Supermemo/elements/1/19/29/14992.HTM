<FONT class=extract>If <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE> is provided, then only the first line of the recipe will be checked for the special prefix characters (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;). Subsequent lines will include the special characters in the recipe line when the <CODE>SHELL</CODE> is invoked.</FONT> If you want your recipe to start with one of these special characters you'll need to <FONT class=clozed>arrange for them to not be the first characters on the first line, perhaps by adding a comment or similar. For example, this would be a syntax error in Perl because the first &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is removed by make: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     .ONESHELL:

     show :
             @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</FONT></PRE>
<P class=noindent><FONT class=clozed>However, either of these alternatives would work properly: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
