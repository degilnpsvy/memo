<FONT class=extract><FONT class=extract>Texture coordinates can comprise one, two, three, or four coordinates. They're usually referred to as the s, t, r, and q</FONT> coordinates to distinguish them from object coordinates (x, y, z, and w) and from evaluator coordinates (u and v; see Chapter 12).</FONT> For one-dimensional textures, you use the s coordinate; for two-dimensional textures, you use s and t. In Release 1.1, the r coordinate is ignored. (Some implementations have 3D texture mapping as an extension, and that extension uses the r coordinate.) The q coordinate, like w, is typically given the value 1 and can be used to create homogeneous coordinates; it's described as an advanced feature in "The q Coordinate."<BR style="CLEAR: both">
