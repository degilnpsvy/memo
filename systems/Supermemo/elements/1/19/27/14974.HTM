Furthermore, when you do set <CODE>SHELL</CODE> in your makefile that value is <EM><FONT class=clozed>not</FONT></EM> exported in the environment to recipe lines that <CODE>make</CODE> invokes. Instead, the value inherited from the user's environment, if any, is exported. You can override this behavior by explicitly exporting <CODE>SHELL</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>), forcing it to be passed in the environment to recipe lines.
