How to prevent that non-terminal match-anything rules be considered to some certain file names? For example, how to make sure that Pascal source files such as <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p</SPAN></SAMP> match a specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted looking for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p.o</SPAN></SAMP> or <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p.c?</SPAN></SAMP>

<P><FONT class=clozed>Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize certain file names so that non-terminal match-anything rules will not be considered. These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no recipes, and they are ignored for all other purposes. For example, the built-in implicit rule </FONT></P><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     </FONT><FONT class=clozed>%.p :
