To gain speed, we have put various constraints on the way <CODE>make</CODE> considers match-anything rules. There are two different constraints that can be applied, and each time you define a match-anything rule you must choose one or the other for that rule.

<P><FONT class=clozed>One choice is to mark the match-anything rule as <DFN>terminal</DFN> by defining it with a double colon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize certain file names so that non-terminal match-anything rules will not be considered</FONT>.
