If you do not mark the match-anything rule as terminal, then it is non-terminal. A non-terminal match-anything rule cannot apply to <FONT class=clozed>a file name that indicates a specific type of data. A file name indicates a specific type of data if some non-match-anything implicit rule target matches it.</FONT> 
<P>For example, <FONT class=clozed>the file name <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> matches the target for the pattern rule &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%.c : %.y</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (the rule to run Yacc). Regardless of whether this rule is actually applicable (which happens only if there is a file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.y</SPAN></SAMP>), the fact that its target matches is enough to prevent consideration of any non-terminal match-anything rules for the file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP>. Thus, <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider trying to make <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> as an executable file from <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c.o</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c.c</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c.p</SPAN></SAMP>, etc.</FONT>
