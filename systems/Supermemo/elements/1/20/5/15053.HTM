The <CODE>override</CODE> directive was not invented for escalation in the war between makefiles and command arguments. It was invented so you can alter and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments. 
<P>For example, <FONT class=clozed>suppose you always want the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-g</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; switch when you run the C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other switches with a command argument just as usual. You could use this <CODE>override</CODE> directive: </FONT><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     override CFLAGS += -g
</FONT></PRE>
<P>You can also use <CODE>override</CODE> directives with <CODE>define</CODE> directives. This is done as you might expect: <PRE class=example>     override define foo =
     bar
     endef
</PRE>
