writing a terminal match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Rules</A>). 
<P></P>
<P>For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source files contain real data, only that they exist. Then you might do this: </P><PRE class=example>     %::
             touch $@
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created automatically.
