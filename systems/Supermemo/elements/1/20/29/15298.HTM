prerequisites. This capability allows you to modify the behavior of a prerequisite based on which targets caused it to be rebuilt. For example, you might set a target-specific variable on a <CODE>debug</CODE> target, then running &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make debug</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will cause that variable to be inherited by all prerequisites of <CODE>debug</CODE>, while just running &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make all</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (for example) would not have that assignment.
