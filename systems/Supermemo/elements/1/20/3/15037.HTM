Another way to set the value of a variable is to use the <CODE>define</CODE> directive. This directive has an unusual syntax which allows <FONT class=clozed>newline</FONT> characters to be included in the value, which is convenient for defining both canned sequences of commands (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Canned-Recipes">Defining Canned Recipes</A>), and also sections of makefile syntax to use with <CODE>eval</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Eval-Function">Eval Function</A>).
