&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting">Setting Variables</A>). Both forms are equivalent in GNU <CODE>make</CODE>; however only the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; form is described by the POSIX standard (support for &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; was added to the POSIX standard in 2012, so older versions of <CODE>make</CODE> won't accept this form either).
