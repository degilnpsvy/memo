When an error happens that <CODE>make</CODE> has not been told to ignore, it implies that <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>

However, if the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-k</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--keep-going</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag is specified, <CODE>make</CODE> continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status. For example, after an error in compiling one object file, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -k</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will continue compiling other object files even though it already knows that linking them will be impossible.
