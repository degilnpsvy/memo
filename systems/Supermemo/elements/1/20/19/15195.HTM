When an error happens that <CODE>make</CODE> has not been told to ignore, it implies that <FONT class=clozed>the current target cannot be correctly remade, and neither can any other that depends on it either directly or indirectly. No further recipes will be executed for these targets, since their preconditions have not been achieved.</FONT>

However, if the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>flag is specified, <CODE>make</CODE> continues to consider the other prerequisites of the pending targets, remaking them if necessary, before it gives up and returns nonzero status.
