What's the shell assignment operator &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>!=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;usage in Make? 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>The shell assignment operator &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>!=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; can be used to execute a program and set a variable to its output. This operator first evaluates the right-hand side, then passes that result to the shell for execution. If the result of the execution ends in a newline, that one newline is removed; all other newlines are replaced by spaces. The resulting string is then placed into the named recursively-expanded variable. For example: </FONT></P><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>     hash != printf '\043'
     file_list != find . -name '*.c'
</FONT></PRE>
