The value in an ordinary assignment cannot contain a newline; but the newlines that separate the lines of the value in a <CODE><FONT class=clozed>define</FONT></CODE> become part of the variable's value (except for the final newline which precedes the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> and is not considered part of the value).
