The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the variable is defined. The actual value of the simply expanded variable is the result of expanding the text that you write. It does not contain any references to other variables; it contains their values <EM>as of the time this variable was defined</EM>. Therefore, <PRE class=example>     x := foo
     y := $(x) bar
     x := later
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>is equivalent to <PRE class=example><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></PRE><PRE class=example><SPAN class=cloze></SPAN>When a simply expanded variable is referenced, its value is substituted verbatim.</PRE>
