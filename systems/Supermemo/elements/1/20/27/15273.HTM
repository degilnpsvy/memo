Like &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>clean</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, but may refrain from deleting a few files that people normally don't want to recompile. For example, the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>mostlyclean</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; target for GCC does not delete <SAMP><SPAN class=file>libgcc.a</SPAN></SAMP>, because recompiling it is rarely necessary and takes a lot of time.
