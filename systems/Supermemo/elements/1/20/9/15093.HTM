suppose you always want the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-g</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; switch when you run the C compiler, but you would like to allow the user to specify the other switches with a command argument just as usual. You could use this <CODE>override</CODE> directive: <PRE class=example>     override CFLAGS += -g
</PRE>
