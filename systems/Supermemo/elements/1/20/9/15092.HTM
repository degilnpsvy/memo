The <CODE>override</CODE> directive was not invented for escalation in the war between makefiles and command arguments. It was invented so you can alter and add to values that the user specifies with command arguments. 
<P>For example, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> 
<P>You can also use <CODE>override</CODE> directives with <CODE>define</CODE> directives. This is done as you might expect: <PRE class=example>     override define foo =
     bar
     endef
</PRE>
