Thus, by setting the variable <CODE><FONT class=clozed>CFLAGS</FONT></CODE> in your environment, you can cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you prefer. This is safe for variables with standard or conventional meanings because you know that no makefile will use them for other things. (Note this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> explicitly and therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)
