<DT><CODE><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></CODE> 
<DD>Contains the name of each makefile that is parsed by <CODE>make</CODE>, in the order in which it was parsed. The name is appended just before <CODE>make</CODE> begins to parse the makefile. Thus, if the first thing a makefile does is examine the last word in this variable, it will be the name of the current makefile. Once the current makefile has used <CODE>include</CODE>, however, the last word will be the just-included makefile.</DD>
