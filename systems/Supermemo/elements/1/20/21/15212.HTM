<FONT class=extract>For your convenience, when GNU <CODE>make</CODE> starts (after it has processed any <CODE>-C</CODE> options) it sets the variable <CODE>CURDIR</CODE> to the pathname of the current working directory.</FONT> This value is never touched by <CODE>make</CODE> again: in particular note that if you include files from other directories the value of <CODE>CURDIR</CODE> does not change. The value has the same precedence it would have if it were set in the makefile (by default, an environment variable <CODE>CURDIR</CODE> will not override this value). Note that setting this variable has no impact on the operation of <CODE>make</CODE> (it does not cause <CODE>make</CODE> to change its working directory, for example).
