Consider the command &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the above example. (The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option marks targets as up to date without actually running any recipes; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Execution</A>.) Following the usual definition of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; command in the example would create a file named <SAMP><SPAN class=file>subsystem</SPAN></SAMP> and do nothing else. What you really want it to do is run &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>cd&nbsp;subdir&nbsp;&amp;&amp;<!-- /@w --> make&nbsp;-t<!-- /@w --></SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; but that would require executing the recipe, and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; says not to execute recipes. <A name=index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dt_007d_002c-and-recursion-394></A><A name=index-recursion_002c-and-_0040code_007b_002dt_007d-395></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dtouch_007d_002c-and-recursion-396></A>

<P>The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever <FONT class=extract>a recipe line of a rule contains the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>, the flags &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-n</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-q</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; do not apply to that line.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Recipe lines containing <CODE>MAKE</CODE> are executed normally despite the presence of a flag that causes most recipes not to be run. The usual <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> mechanism passes the flags to the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_002fRecursion"><FONT class=extract>Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), so your request to touch the files, or print the recipes, is propagated to the subsystem.</FONT>
