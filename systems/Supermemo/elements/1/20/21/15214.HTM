Using the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable has the same effect as using a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp><FONT class=clozed>+</FONT></SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character at the beginning of the recipe line. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing the Recipes</A>. This special feature is only enabled if the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable appears directly in the recipe: it does not apply if the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable is referenced through expansion of another variable. In the latter case you must use the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; token to get these special effects.
