Every rule that produces an object file uses the variable <CODE>OUTPUT_OPTION</CODE>. <CODE>make</CODE> defines this variable either to contain &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-o $@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, or to be empty, depending on a compile-time option. You need the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option to ensure that the output goes into the right file when the source file is in a different directory, as when using <CODE>VPATH</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search">Directory Search</A>). 
<P></P>
<P>However, compilers on some systems do not accept a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; switch for object files. If you use such a system, and use <CODE>VPATH</CODE>, some compilations will put their output in the wrong place. A possible workaround for this problem is to give <CODE>OUTPUT_OPTION</CODE> the value &#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217;<!-- /@w -->.
