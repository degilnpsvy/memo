Likewise, you can use <CODE><FONT class=clozed>unexport</FONT></CODE> by itself to tell <CODE>make</CODE> <EM>not</EM> to export variables by default. Since this is the default behavior, you would only need to do this if <CODE>export</CODE> had been used by itself earlier (in an included makefile, perhaps). You <STRONG>cannot</STRONG> use <CODE>export</CODE> and <CODE>unexport</CODE> by themselves to have variables exported for some recipes and not for others. The last <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive that appears by itself determines the behavior for the entire run of <CODE>make</CODE>.
