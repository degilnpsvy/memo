for example: <PRE class=example>     %.o: %.c
             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@
     
     lib/%.o: CFLAGS := -fPIC -g
     %.o: CFLAGS := -g
     
     all: foo.o lib/bar.o
</PRE>
<P>In this example <FONT class=clozed>the first definition of the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> variable will be used to update <SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib/bar.o</SPAN></SAMP> even though the second one also applies to this target(And the less specific one is applied first). Pattern-specific variables which result in the same stem length are considered in the order in which they were defined in the makefile.</FONT>
