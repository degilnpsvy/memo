<DD>Expands to a list of the <EM>names</EM> of all global variables defined so far. This includes variables which have empty values, as well as built-in variables (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Variables">Variables Used by Implicit Rules</A>), but does not include any variables which are only defined in a target-specific context. Note that any value you assign to this variable will be ignored; it will always return its special value.
