Variables in <CODE>make</CODE> can come from the environment in which <CODE>make</CODE> is run. Every environment variable that <CODE>make</CODE> sees when it starts up is transformed into a <CODE>make</CODE> variable with the same name and value. However, <FONT class=clozed>an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command argument, overrides the environment. (If the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-e</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag is specified, then values from the environment override assignments in the makefile. See </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary"><FONT class=clozed>Summary of Options</FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>. But this is not recommended practice.)</FONT>
