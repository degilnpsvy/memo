As a special feature, the variable <CODE><FONT class=clozed>MAKELEVEL</FONT></CODE> is changed when it is passed down from level to level. This variable's value is a string which is the depth of the level as a decimal number. The value is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>0</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; for the top-level <CODE>make</CODE>; &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>1</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; for a sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>2</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; for a sub-sub-<CODE>make</CODE>, and so on. The incrementation happens when <CODE>make</CODE> sets up the environment for a recipe.
