When <CODE>make</CODE> runs a recipe, variables defined in the makefile are placed into the environment of each shell. This allows you to pass values to sub-<CODE>make</CODE> invocations (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>). By default, only variables that <FONT class=clozed>came from the environment or the command line</FONT> are passed to recursive invocations. You can use the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> directive to pass other variables. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>, for full details.
