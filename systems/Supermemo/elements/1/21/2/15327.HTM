an explicit assignment in the makefile, or with a command argument, overrides the environment. (If the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-e</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag is specified, then values from the environment override assignments in the makefile. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</A>. But this is not recommended practice.)
