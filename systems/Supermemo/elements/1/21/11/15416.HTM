arrange for them to not be the first characters on the first line, perhaps by adding a comment or similar. For example, this would be a syntax error in Perl because the first &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is removed by make: <PRE class=example>     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
     show :
             @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>However, either of these alternatives would work properly: <PRE class=example>     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
     show :
             # Make sure "@" is not the first character on the first line
             @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>or <PRE class=example>     .ONESHELL:
     SHELL = /usr/bin/perl
     .SHELLFLAGS = -e
     show :
             my @f = qw(a b c);
             print "@f\n";
</PRE>
