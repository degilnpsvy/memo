Special built-in dummy pattern rules are provided solely to recognize certain file names so that non-terminal match-anything rules will not be considered. These dummy rules have no prerequisites and no recipes, and they are ignored for all other purposes. For example, the built-in implicit rule <PRE class=example>     <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></PRE>
<P class=noindent>exists to make sure that Pascal source files such as <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p</SPAN></SAMP> match a specific target pattern and thereby prevent time from being wasted looking for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p.o</SPAN></SAMP> or <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p.c</SPAN></SAMP>. 
<P>Dummy pattern rules such as the one for &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%.p</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; are made for every suffix listed as valid for use in suffix rules (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Suffix-Rules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</A>).
