It is sometimes useful to define recipes which do nothing. This is done simply by giving a recipe that consists of nothing but whitespace. For example: <PRE class=example>     <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></PRE>
<P class=noindent>defines an empty recipe for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>target</SPAN></SAMP>.
