So generally the right thing to do is to delete the target file if the recipe fails after beginning to change the file. <CODE>make</CODE> will do this if <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> appears as a target. This is almost always what you want <CODE>make</CODE> to do, but it is not historical practice; so for compatibility, you must explicitly request it.
