When a pattern rule's target is just &#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217;, it matches any file name whatever. We call these rules <FONT class=clozed><DFN>match-anything</DFN> rules</FONT>. They are very useful, but it can take a lot of time for <CODE>make</CODE> to think about them, because it must consider every such rule for each file name listed either as a target or as a prerequisite.
