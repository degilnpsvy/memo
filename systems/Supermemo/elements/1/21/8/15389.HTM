When the variable in question has not been defined before, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; acts&nbsp;like&nbsp;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. However, when there <EM>is</EM> a previous definition, exactly what &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; does depends on what flavor of variable you defined originally. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">The Two Flavors of Variables</A>, for an explanation of the two flavors of variables.
