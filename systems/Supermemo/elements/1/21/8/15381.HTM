<P><CODE>If the target is an archive member, then &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is the name of the archive file. In a pattern rule that has multiple targets (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Intro">Introduction to Pattern Rules</A>), &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is the name of whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be run.</CODE>
