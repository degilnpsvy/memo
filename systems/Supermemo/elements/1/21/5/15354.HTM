A variable name may be any sequence of characters not containing &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>#</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, or whitespace. However, variable names containing characters other than <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>should be considered carefully, as in some shells they cannot be passed through the environment to a sub-<CODE>make</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></A>). Variable names beginning with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and an uppercase letter may be given special meaning in future versions of <CODE>make</CODE>.
