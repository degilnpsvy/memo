&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>#</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in a line of a makefile starts a <DFN>comment</DFN>. It and the rest of the line are ignored, except that a trailing backslash <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> will continue the comment across multiple lines. A line containing just a comment (with perhaps spaces before it) is effectively blank, and is ignored. If you want a literal <CODE>#</CODE>, escape it with a backslash (e.g., <CODE>\#</CODE>). Comments may appear on any line in the makefile, although they are treated specially in certain situations.
