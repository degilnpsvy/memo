By default, the goal is the first target in the makefile (not counting targets that start with a period). Therefore, makefiles are usually written so that the first target is for compiling the entire program or programs they describe. If the first rule in the makefile has several targets, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. You can manage the selection of the default goal from within your makefile using the <CODE>.DEFAULT_GOAL</CODE> variable (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Other Special Variables</A>).
