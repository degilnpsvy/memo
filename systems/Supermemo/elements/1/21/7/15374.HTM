Normally, you do not need to specify this option because &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; does it for you: &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-w</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is turned on automatically when you use the &#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217; option, and in sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s. <CODE>make</CODE> will not automatically turn on &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-w</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; if you also use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-s</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, which says to be silent, or if you use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--no-print-directory</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; to explicitly disable it.
