When you add to a variable's value with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, <CODE>make</CODE> acts essentially as if you had included the extra text in the initial definition of the variable. If you defined it first with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, making it a simply-expanded variable, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; adds to that simply-expanded definition, and expands the new text before appending it to the old value just as &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; does (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Setting">Setting Variables</A>, for a full explanation of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;). In fact, <PRE class=example>     variable := value
     variable += more
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>is exactly equivalent to: </P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>
