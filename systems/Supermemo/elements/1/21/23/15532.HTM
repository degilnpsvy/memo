&#8216;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#8217; is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only the prerequisites that have changed. For example, suppose that an archive named <SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib</SPAN></SAMP> is supposed to contain copies of several object files. This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive: <PRE class=example>     lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
             ar r lib <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></PRE>
