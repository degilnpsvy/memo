Don't assume that <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.</SPAN></SAMP> is in the path for command execution. When you need to run programs that are a part of your package during the make, please make sure that it uses <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> if the program is built as part of the make or <SAMP><SPAN class=file>$(srcdir)/</SPAN></SAMP> if the file is an unchanging part of the source code. Without one of these prefixes, the current search path is used.
