&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--file</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--makefile</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; also works). For example, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f altmake</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; says to use the file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>altmake</SPAN></SAMP> as the makefile.
