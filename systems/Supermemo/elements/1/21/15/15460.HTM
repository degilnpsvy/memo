use <CODE>export</CODE> by itself: <PRE class=example>     export
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>This tells <CODE>make</CODE> that variables which are not explicitly mentioned in an <CODE>export</CODE> or <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive should be exported. Any variable given in an <CODE>unexport</CODE> directive will still <EM>not</EM> be exported. If you use <CODE>export</CODE> by itself to export variables by default, variables whose names contain characters other than alphanumerics and underscores will not be exported unless specifically mentioned in an <CODE>export</CODE> directive.
