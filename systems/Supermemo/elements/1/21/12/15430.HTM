For example, normally if any line in the recipe fails, that causes the rule to fail and no more recipe lines are processed. Under <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE> a failure of any but the final recipe line will not be noticed by <CODE>make</CODE>. You can <FONT class=clozed>modify <CODE>.SHELLFLAGS</CODE> to add the <CODE>-e</CODE> option to the shell which will cause any failure anywhere in the command line to cause the shell to fail, but this could itself cause your recipe to behave differently. Ultimately you may need to harden your recipe lines to allow them to work with <CODE>.ONESHELL</CODE>.</FONT>
