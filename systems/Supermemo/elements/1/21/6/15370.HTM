<CODE>$^</CODE></P>
<P><CODE>For prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Archives">Archives</A>). A target has only one prerequisite on each other file it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a prerequisite. So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target, the value of <CODE>$^</CODE> contains just one copy of the name. <FONT class=extract>This list does <STRONG>not</STRONG> contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for those see the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$|</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; variable, below.</FONT></CODE>
