<P>Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved and passed to the shell. How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your shell. If the first character of the next line after the backslash/newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab by default; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Special Variables</A>), then that character (and only that character) is removed. Whitespace is never added to the recipe.
