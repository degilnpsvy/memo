Set a target-specific variable value like this: <PRE class=example>     <VAR>target</VAR> ... : <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR>
</PRE>
<P><FONT class=extract>Target-specific variable assignments can be prefixed with any or all of the special keywords <CODE>export</CODE>, <CODE>override</CODE>, or <CODE>private</CODE>; these apply their normal behavior to this instance of the variable only. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=extract>Multiple <VAR>target</VAR> values create a target-specific variable value for each member of the target list individually. </FONT>
<P>The <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR> can be any valid form of assignment; recursive (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;), simple (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>:=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>::=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;), appending (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;), or conditional (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>?=</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;). All variables that appear within the <VAR>variable-assignment</VAR> are evaluated within the context of the target: thus, any previously-defined target-specific variable values will be in effect. Note that this variable is actually distinct from any &#8220;global&#8221; value: the two variables do not have to have the same flavor (recursive vs. simple).
