There is one more special feature of target-specific variables: when you define a target-specific variable that variable value is also in effect for all prerequisites of this target, and all their prerequisites, etc. (unless those prerequisites override that variable with their own target-specific variable value). So, for example, a statement like this: <PRE class=example>     prog : CFLAGS = -g
     prog : prog.o foo.o bar.o
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>will set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-g</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the recipe for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>prog</SPAN></SAMP>, but it will also set <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> to &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-g</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the recipes that create <SAMP><SPAN class=file>prog.o</SPAN></SAMP>, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP>, and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>bar.o</SPAN></SAMP>, and any recipes which create their prerequisites.
