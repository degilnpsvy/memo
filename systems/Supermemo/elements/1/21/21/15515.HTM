For example, in the default C locale, &#8216;<SAMP>[a-dx-z]</SAMP>&#8217; is equivalent to &#8216;<SAMP>[abcdxyz]</SAMP>&#8217;. Many locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales &#8216;<SAMP>[a-dx-z]</SAMP>&#8217; is typically not equivalent to &#8216;<SAMP>[abcdxyz]</SAMP>&#8217;; it might be equivalent to &#8216;<SAMP>[aBbCcDdxXyYz]</SAMP>&#8217;, for example.

<P>To obtain the traditional interpretation of ranges in bracket expressions, you can force the use of the C locale by setting <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>.
