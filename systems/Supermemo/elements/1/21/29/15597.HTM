<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 19.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt" lang=EN-US>For testing purposes, it can sometimes be useful to selectively override functions (and other symbols) that would normally be found by the dynamic linker using the rules described in Section 41.11. To do this, we can define <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 19.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt" lang=EN-US> that should be loaded before any other shared libraries. Since these libraries are loaded first, any functions they define will automatically be used if required by the executable, thus overriding any other functions of the same name that the dynamic linker would otherwise have searched for.</SPAN>
