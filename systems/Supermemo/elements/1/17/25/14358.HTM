<DD><A name=index-notdir-615></A><A name=index-file-name_002c-nondirectory-part-616></A><A name=index-nondirectory-part-617></A>Extracts all but the directory-part of each file name in <VAR>names</VAR>. If the file name contains no slash, it is left unchanged. Otherwise, everything through the last slash is removed from it. 
<P>A file name that ends with a slash becomes an empty string. This is unfortunate, because it means that the result does not always have the same number of whitespace-separated file names as the argument had; but we do not see any other valid alternative.
