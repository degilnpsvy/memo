The result of this function is a string containing the value of <VAR>variable</VAR>, without any expansion occurring. For example, in this makefile: <PRE class=example>     FOO = $PATH
     
     all:
             @echo $(FOO)
             @echo $(value FOO)
</PRE>
<P class=noindent><FONT class=clozed>The first output line would be <CODE>ATH</CODE>, since the &#8220;$P&#8221; would be expanded as a <CODE>make</CODE> variable, while the second output line would be the current value of your <CODE>$PATH</CODE> environment variable, since the <CODE>value</CODE> function avoided the expansion.</FONT>
