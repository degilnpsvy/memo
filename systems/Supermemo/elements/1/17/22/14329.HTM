Usually, you want to change only the variables listed in the table above, which are documented in the following section. 
<P><FONT class=extract>However, the recipes in built-in implicit rules actually use variables such as <CODE>COMPILE.c</CODE>, <CODE>LINK.p</CODE>, and <CODE>PREPROCESS.S</CODE>, whose values contain the recipes listed above.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract><CODE>make</CODE> follows the convention that the rule to compile a <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.</SPAN><VAR>x</VAR></SAMP> source file uses the variable <CODE>COMPILE.</CODE><VAR>x</VAR>. Similarly, the rule to produce an executable from a <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.</SPAN><VAR>x</VAR></SAMP> file uses <CODE>LINK.</CODE><VAR>x</VAR>; and the rule to preprocess a <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.</SPAN><VAR>x</VAR></SAMP> file uses <CODE>PREPROCESS.</CODE><VAR>x</VAR>.</FONT>
