The precise recipe used is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(GET)&nbsp;$(GFLAGS)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w -->. The rules for SCCS are terminal (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A>), so SCCS files cannot be generated from another source; they must actually exist. 
<P><A name=index-g_t_002esh-882></A>For the benefit of SCCS, a file <SAMP><VAR>n</VAR></SAMP> is copied from <SAMP><VAR>n</VAR><SPAN class=file>.sh</SPAN></SAMP> and made executable (by everyone). This is for shell scripts that are checked into SCCS. Since RCS preserves the execution permission of a file, you do not need to use this feature with RCS. 
<P>We recommend that you avoid using of SCCS. RCS is widely held to be superior, and is also free. By choosing free software in place of comparable (or inferior) proprietary software, you support the free software movement.</P></DD>
