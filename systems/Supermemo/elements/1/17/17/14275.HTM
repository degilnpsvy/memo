This information is primarily useful (other than for your curiosity) to determine if you want to believe the value of a variable. For example, suppose you have a makefile <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> that includes another makefile <SAMP><SPAN class=file>bar</SPAN></SAMP>. You want a variable <CODE>bletch</CODE> to be defined in <SAMP><SPAN class=file>bar</SPAN></SAMP> if you run the command &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make&nbsp;-f&nbsp;bar</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w -->, even if the environment contains a definition of <CODE>bletch</CODE>. However, if <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> defined <CODE>bletch</CODE> before including <SAMP><SPAN class=file>bar</SPAN></SAMP>, you do not want to override that definition. This could be done by using an <CODE>override</CODE> directive in <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP>, giving that definition precedence over the later definition in <SAMP><SPAN class=file>bar</SPAN></SAMP>; unfortunately, the <CODE>override</CODE> directive would also override any command line definitions. So, <SAMP><SPAN class=file>bar</SPAN></SAMP> could include: <PRE class=example>     ifdef bletch
     ifeq "$(origin bletch)" "environment"
     bletch = barf, gag, etc.
     endif
     endif
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>If <CODE>bletch</CODE> has been defined from the environment, this will redefine it. 
<P>If you want to override a previous definition of <CODE>bletch</CODE> if it came from the environment, even under &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-e</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, you could instead write: <PRE class=example>     ifneq "$(findstring environment,$(origin bletch))" ""
     bletch = barf, gag, etc.
     endif
</PRE>
<P>Here the redefinition takes place if &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(origin bletch)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; returns either &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>environment</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>environment override</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;.
