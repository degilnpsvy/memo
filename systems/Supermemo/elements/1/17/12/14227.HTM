<P>Central to motion planning is determining whether one part of a space is reachable from another. In Chapter 2, one state was reached from another by applying a sequence of actions. For motion planning, the analog to this is connecting one point in the configuration space to another by a continuous path. Graph connectivity is important in the discrete planning case. An analog to this for topological spaces is presented in this section.
