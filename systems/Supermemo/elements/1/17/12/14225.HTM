<P>Many important, 2D manifolds can be defined by applying the Cartesian product to 1D manifolds. The 2D manifold <!-- MATH

 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=19 alt="$ {\mathbb{R}}^2$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img10.gif" width=26 align=bottom border=0></SPAN> is formed by <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{R}}

 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=34 alt="$ {\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{R}}$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1091.gif" width=56 align=middle border=0></SPAN>. The product <!-- MATH

 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=38 alt="$ {\mathbb{R}}\times {\mathbb{S}}^1$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1101.gif" width=60 align=middle border=0></SPAN> defines a manifold that is equivalent to an infinite cylinder. The product <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{S}}^1 \times {\mathbb{S}}^1$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=38 alt="$ {\mathbb{S}}^1 \times {\mathbb{S}}^1$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1102.gif" width=64 align=middle border=0></SPAN> is a manifold that is equivalent to a torus (the surface of a donut).

<P>Can any other 2D manifolds be defined? See Figure <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node136.html#fig:2dmanifolds">4.5</A>. The identification idea can be applied to generate several new manifolds. Start with an open square <!-- MATH
 $M = (0,1)
\times (0,1)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ M = (0,1)&#10;\times (0,1)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1104.gif" width=157 align=middle border=0></SPAN>, which is homeomorphic to <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{R}}^2$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=19 alt="$ {\mathbb{R}}^2$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img10.gif" width=26 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>. Let <SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ (x,y)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img84.gif" width=48 align=middle border=0></SPAN> denote a point in the plane. A <EM>flat cylinder</EM><A name=13505></A> is obtained by making the identification <!-- MATH
 $(0,y) \sim (1,y)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ (0,y) \sim (1,y)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1105.gif" width=114 align=middle border=0></SPAN> for all <!-- MATH
 $y \in (0,1)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ y \in (0,1)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1106.gif" width=80 align=middle border=0></SPAN> and adding all of these points to <SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=17 alt="$ M$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>. The result is depicted in Figure <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node136.html#fig:2dmanifolds">4.5</A> by drawing arrows where the identification occurs. 
<P>A <EM>M&#246;bius band</EM><A name=13507></A> can be constructed by taking a strip of paper and connecting the ends after making a 180-degree twist. This result is not homeomorphic to the cylinder. The M&#246;bius band can also be constructed by putting the twist into the identification, as <!-- MATH
 $(0,y)
\sim (1,1-y)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ (0,y)&#10;\sim (1,1-y)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1107.gif" width=147 align=middle border=0></SPAN> for all <!-- MATH
 $y \in (0,1)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ y \in (0,1)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1106.gif" width=80 align=middle border=0></SPAN>. In this case, the arrows are drawn in opposite directions. The M&#246;bius band has the famous properties that it has only one side (trace along the paper strip with a pencil, and you will visit both sides of the paper) and is nonorientable (if you try to draw it in the plane, without using identification tricks, it will always have a twist). 
<P>For all of the cases so far, there has been a boundary to the set. The next few manifolds will not even have a boundary, even though they may be bounded. If you were to live in one of them, it means that you could walk forever along any trajectory and never encounter the edge of your universe. It might seem like our physical universe is unbounded, but it would only be an illusion. Furthermore, there are several distinct possibilities for the universe that are not homeomorphic to each other. In higher dimensions, such possibilities are the subject of cosmology, which is a branch of astrophysics that uses topology to characterize the structure of our universe. 
<P>A <EM>torus</EM><A name=13509></A> can be constructed by performing identifications of the form <!-- MATH
 $(0,y) \sim (1,y)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ (0,y) \sim (1,y)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1105.gif" width=114 align=middle border=0></SPAN>, which was done for the cylinder, and also <!-- MATH
 $(x,0) \sim (x,1)$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ (x,0) \sim (x,1)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1108.gif" width=116 align=middle border=0></SPAN>, which identifies the top and bottom. Note that the point <SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=37 alt="$ (0,0)$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img279.gif" width=46 align=middle border=0></SPAN> must be included and is identified with three other points. Double arrows are used in Figure <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node136.html#fig:2dmanifolds">4.5</A> to indicate the top and bottom identification. All of the identification points must be added to <SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=17 alt="$ M$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1.gif" width=25 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>. Note that there are no twists. A funny interpretation of the resulting <EM>flat torus</EM><A name=13511></A> is as the universe appears for a spacecraft in some 1980s-style <EM>Asteroids</EM>-like<A name=12048></A> video games. The spaceship flies off of the screen in one direction and appears somewhere else, as prescribed by the identification. 
<P>Two interesting manifolds can be made by adding twists. Consider performing all of the identifications that were made for the torus, except put a twist in the side identification, as was done for the M&#246;bius band<A name=13513></A>. This yields a fascinating manifold called the <EM>Klein bottle</EM><A name=13515></A>, which can be embedded in <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{R}}^4$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=19 alt="$ {\mathbb{R}}^4$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1109.gif" width=26 align=bottom border=0></SPAN> as a closed 2D surface in which the inside and the outside are the same! (This is in a sense similar to that of the M&#246;bius band.) Now suppose there are twists in both the sides and the top and bottom. This results in the most bizarre manifold yet: the real projective plane, <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{RP}}^2$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=21 alt="$ {\mathbb{RP}}^2$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1110.gif" width=38 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>. This space is equivalent to the set of all lines in <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{R}}^3$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=19 alt="$ {\mathbb{R}}^3$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img23.gif" width=26 align=bottom border=0></SPAN> that pass through the origin. The 3D version, <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{RP}}^3$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=21 alt="$ {\mathbb{RP}}^3$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1111.gif" width=38 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>, happens to be one of the most important manifolds for motion planning! 
<P>Let <!-- MATH
 ${\mathbb{S}}^2$
 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=19 alt="$ {\mathbb{S}}^2$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img1112.gif" width=23 align=bottom border=0></SPAN> denote the unit sphere, which is defined as
