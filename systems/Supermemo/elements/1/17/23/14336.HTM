You can prevent automatic deletion of an intermediate file by <FONT class=clozed>marking it as a <DFN>secondary</DFN> file. To do this, list it as a prerequisite of the special target <CODE>.SECONDARY</CODE>. When a file is secondary, <CODE>make</CODE> will not create the file merely because it does not already exist, but <CODE>make</CODE> does not automatically delete the file. Marking a file as secondary also marks it as intermediate.</FONT>
