You define an implicit rule by <FONT class=clozed>writing a <DFN>pattern rule</DFN>. A pattern rule looks like an ordinary rule, except that its target contains the character &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (exactly one of them). The target is considered a pattern for matching file names; the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; can match any nonempty substring, while other characters match only themselves. The prerequisites likewise use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; to show how their names relate to the target name. </FONT>
<P><FONT class=clozed>Thus, a pattern rule &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%.o : %.c</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; says how to make any file <SAMP><VAR>stem</VAR><SPAN class=file>.o</SPAN></SAMP> from another file <SAMP><VAR>stem</VAR><SPAN class=file>.c</SPAN></SAMP>.</FONT>
