<FONT class=extract>You can list the target pattern of an implicit rule (such as &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%.o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) as a prerequisite of the special target <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE> to preserve intermediate files made by implicit rules whose target patterns match that file's name; see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Interrupts"><FONT class=extract>Interrupts</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>.</FONT> <A name=index-preserving-with-_0040code_007b_002ePRECIOUS_007d-949></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007b_002ePRECIOUS_007d-intermediate-files-950></A>A chain can involve more than two implicit rules. For example, it is possible to make a file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> from <SAMP><SPAN class=file>RCS/foo.y,v</SPAN></SAMP> by running RCS, Yacc and <CODE>cc</CODE>. Then both <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.y</SPAN></SAMP> and <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> are intermediate files that are deleted at the end. 
<P><FONT class=extract>No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain. This means that <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as making <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> from <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o.o</SPAN></SAMP> by running the linker twice. This constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the search for an implicit rule chain.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract>There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would otherwise be handled by rule chains. For example, making <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> from <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> could be handled by compiling and linking with separate chained rules, using <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP> as an intermediate file. But what actually happens is that a special rule for this case does the compilation and linking with a single <CODE>cc</CODE> command. The optimized rule is used in preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes earlier in the ordering of rules.</FONT>
