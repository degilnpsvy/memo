A final caution: be careful when adding <FONT class=clozed>whitespace</FONT> to the arguments to <CODE>call</CODE>. As with other functions, any whitespace contained in the second and subsequent arguments is kept; this can cause strange effects. It's generally safest to remove all extraneous whitespace when providing parameters to <CODE>call</CODE>.
