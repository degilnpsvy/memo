It's very important that you recognize the limited scope in which automatic variable values are available: they only have values <FONT class=clozed>within the recipe</FONT>. In particular, you cannot use them anywhere within the target list of a rule; they have no value there and will expand to the empty string. Also, they cannot be accessed directly within the prerequisite list of a rule. A common mistake is attempting to use <CODE>$@</CODE> within the prerequisites list; this will not work. However, there is a special feature of GNU <CODE>make</CODE>, secondary expansion (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Secondary-Expansion">Secondary Expansion</A>), which will allow automatic variable values to be used in prerequisite lists.
