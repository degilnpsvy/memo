Here is a second built-in rule: <PRE class=example>     % :: RCS/%,v
             $(CO) $(COFLAGS) $&lt;
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>defines a rule that can make any file <SAMP><VAR>x</VAR></SAMP> whatsoever from a corresponding file <SAMP><VAR>x</VAR><SPAN class=file>,v</SPAN></SAMP> in the sub-directory <SAMP><SPAN class=file>RCS</SPAN></SAMP>. Since the target is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, this rule will apply to any file whatever, provided the appropriate prerequisite file exists. The double colon makes the rule <DFN>terminal</DFN>, which means that its prerequisite may not be an intermediate file (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Pattern Rules</A>).
