Thus, a rule of the form <PRE class=example>     %.o : %.c ; <VAR>recipe</VAR>...
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>specifies how to make a file <SAMP><VAR>n</VAR><SPAN class=file>.o</SPAN></SAMP>, with another file <SAMP><VAR>n</VAR><SPAN class=file>.c</SPAN></SAMP> as its prerequisite, provided that <SAMP><VAR>n</VAR><SPAN class=file>.c</SPAN></SAMP> exists or can be made. 
<P>There may also be prerequisites that do not use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; such a prerequisite attaches to every file made by this pattern rule. These unvarying prerequisites are useful occasionally.
