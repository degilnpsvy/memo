<DD>This means the first thing in the makefile seems to be part of a recipe: it begins with a recipe prefix character and doesn't appear to be a legal <CODE>make</CODE> directive (such as a variable assignment). Recipes must always be associated with a target. 
<P>The second form is generated if the line has a semicolon as the first non-whitespace character; <CODE>make</CODE> interprets this to mean you left out the "target: prerequisite" section of a rule. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Rule-Syntax">Rule Syntax</A>.</P></DD>
