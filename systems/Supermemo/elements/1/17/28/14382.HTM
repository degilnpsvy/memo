When the target pattern does not contain a slash (and it usually does not), what to do with a file name? 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>directory names in the file names are removed from the file name before it is compared with the target prefix and suffix. After the comparison of the file name to the target pattern, the directory names, along with the slash that ends them, are added on to the prerequisite file names generated from the pattern rule's prerequisite patterns and the file name. The directories are ignored only for the purpose of finding an implicit rule to use, not in the application of that rule. Thus, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>e%t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; matches the file name <SAMP><SPAN class=file>src/eat</SPAN></SAMP>, with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>src/a</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; as the stem. When prerequisites are turned into file names, the directories from the stem are added at the front, while the rest of the stem is substituted for the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>%</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. The stem &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>src/a</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; with a prerequisite pattern &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>c%r</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; gives the file name <SAMP><SPAN class=file>src/car</SPAN></SAMP>.</FONT>
