In Bash, when the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> operators are used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules described below in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html#Pattern-Matching">Pattern Matching</A>. If the shell option <CODE>nocasematch</CODE> (see the description of <CODE>shopt</CODE> in <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</A>) is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters. The return value is 0 if the string matches (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) or does not match (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;)the pattern, and 1 otherwise. Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force it to be matched as a string.
