<H2><A name=SECTION03011000000000000000>Planning in Continuous Spaces</A> </H2>
<P>Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A> makes the transition from discrete to continuous state spaces. Two alternative titles are appropriate for this part: 1) <EM>motion planning</EM>, or 2) <EM>planning in continuous state spaces</EM>. Chapters <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node76.html#cha:geom">3</A>-<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node363.html#cha:feedback">8</A> are based on research from the field of motion planning, which has been building since the 1970s; therefore, the name <EM>motion planning</EM> is widely known to refer to the collection of models and algorithms that will be covered. On the other hand, it is convenient to also think of Part <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node71.html#par:mp">II</A> as <EM>planning in continuous spaces</EM> because this is the primary distinction with respect to most other forms of planning. 
<P>In addition, motion planning will frequently refer to motions of a <EM>robot</EM> in a 2D or 3D <EM>world</EM> that contains <EM>obstacles</EM>. The robot could model an actual robot, or any other collection of moving bodies, such as humans or flexible molecules. A <EM>motion plan</EM> involves determining what motions are appropriate for the robot so that it reaches a goal state without colliding into obstacles. Recall the examples from Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node5.html#sec:ill">1.2</A>. 
<P>Many issues that arose in Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node35.html#cha:discrete">2</A> appear once again in motion planning. Two themes that may help to see the connection are as follows.
