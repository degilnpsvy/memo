<P>The choice of a model often depends on the types of operations that will be performed by the planning algorithm. For combinatorial motion planning methods, to be covered in Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node254.html#cha:comb">6</A>, the particular representation is critical. On the other hand, for sampling-based planning methods, to be covered in Chapter <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node181.html#cha:sampling">5</A>, the particular representation is important only to the collision detection algorithm, which is treated as a ``black box'' as far as planning is concerned. Therefore, the models given in the remainder of this section are more likely to appear in sampling-based approaches and may be invisible to the designer of a planning algorithm (although it is never wise to forget completely about the representation).
