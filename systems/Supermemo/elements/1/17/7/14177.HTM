 --><SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=20 alt="$ {\cal W}= {\mathbb{R}}^3$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img640.gif" width=72 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>, it is possible to discretize a bounded portion of the world into rectangular cells that may or may not be occupied. The resulting model looks very similar to Example <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node38.html#exa:disgrid">2.1</A>. The resolution of this discretization determines the number of cells per axis and the quality of the approximation. The representation may be considered as a binary image in which each ``1'' in the image corresponds to a rectangular region that contains at least one point of <SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=17 alt="$ {\cal O}$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img55.gif" width=21 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>, and ``0'' represents those that do not contain any of <SPAN class=MATH><IMG height=17 alt="$ {\cal O}$" src="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/img55.gif" width=21 align=bottom border=0></SPAN>. Although bitmaps do not have the elegance of the other models, they often arise in applications. One example is a digital map constructed by a mobile robot that explores an environment with its sensors. One generalization of bitmaps is a <EM>gray-scale map</EM><A name=8715></A> or <EM>occupancy grid</EM><A name=8717></A>. In this case, a numerical value may be assigned to each cell, indicating quantities such as ``the probability that an obstacle exists'' or the ``expected difficulty of traversing the cell.'' The latter interpretation is often used in terrain maps for navigating planetary rovers.
