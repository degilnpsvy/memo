<P>Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node124.html#sec:topology">4.1</A> introduced the basic definitions and concepts of topology. Further study of this fascinating subject can provide a much deeper understanding of configuration spaces. There are many books on topology, some of which may be intimidating, depending on your level of math training. For a heavily illustrated, gentle introduction to topology, see [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Kin93">535</A>]. Another gentle introduction appears in [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Kah95">496</A>]. An excellent text at the graduate level is available on-line: [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Hat02">439</A>]. Other sources include [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Arm83">38</A>,<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#HocYou61">451</A>]. To understand the motivation for many technical definitions in topology, [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#SteSte96">911</A>] is helpful. The manifold coverage in Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node131.html#sec:manifolds">4.1.2</A> was simpler than that found in most sources because most sources introduce <EM>smooth manifolds</EM>, which are complicated by differentiability requirements (these were not needed in this chapter); see Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node384.html#sec:diffman">8.3.2</A> for smooth manifolds. For the configuration spaces of points moving on a topological graph, see [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#AbrGhr02">5</A>]. 
<P>Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node144.html#sec:def-cspace">4.2</A> provided basic C-space definitions. For further reading on matrix groups and their topological properties, see [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Bak02">63</A>], which provides a transition into more advanced material on Lie group theory. For more about quaternions in engineering, see [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#ChiKya01">210</A>,<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Kui02">563</A>]. The remainder of Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node144.html#sec:def-cspace">4.2</A> and most of Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node156.html#sec:col-reg">4.3</A> were inspired by the coverage in [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Lat91">588</A>]. C-spaces are also covered in [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#ChoLynHutKanBurKavThr05">220</A>]. For further reading on computing representations of <!-- MATH

<P>Much of the presentation in Section <A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node168.html#sec:closure">4.4</A> was inspired by the nice introduction to algebraic varieties in [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#CoxLitOsh92">250</A>], which even includes robotics examples; methods for determining the dimension of a variety are also covered. More algorithmic coverage appears in [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Mis93">704</A>]. See [<A href="http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node858.html#Mer00">693</A>] for detailed coverage of robots that are designed with closed kinematic chains.
