To allow <CODE>make</CODE> to find a customary method for updating a target file, all you have to do is refrain from specifying recipes yourself. Either <FONT class=clozed>write a rule with no recipe</FONT>, or don't write a rule at all. Then <CODE>make</CODE> will figure out which implicit rule to use based on which kind of source file exists or can be made.
