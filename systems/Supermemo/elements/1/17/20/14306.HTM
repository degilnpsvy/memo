Above, we said an implicit rule applies if the required prerequisites &#8220;<FONT class=clozed>exist or can be made</FONT>&#8221;. A file &#8220;can be made&#8221; if it is mentioned explicitly in the makefile as a target or a prerequisite, or if an implicit rule can be recursively found for how to make it. When an implicit prerequisite is the result of another implicit rule, we say that <DFN>chaining</DFN> is occurring. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</A>.
