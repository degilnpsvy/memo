In general, <CODE>make</CODE> searches for an implicit rule for each target, and for each double-colon rule, that <FONT class=clozed>has no recipe</FONT>. A file that is mentioned only as <FONT class=clozed>a prerequisite is considered a target whose rule specifies nothing</FONT>, so implicit rule search happens for it. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rule-Search">Implicit Rule Search Algorithm</A>, for the details of how the search is done.
