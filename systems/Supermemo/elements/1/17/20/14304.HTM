If an implicit rule is found, it can supply both a recipe and one or more prerequisites (the source files). You would want to write <FONT class=clozed>a rule for <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP> with no recipe</FONT> if you need to specify additional prerequisites, such as header files, that the implicit rule cannot supply.
