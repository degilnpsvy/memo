Note that explicit prerequisites <FONT class=clozed>do not</FONT> influence implicit rule search. For example, consider this explicit rule: <PRE class=example>     foo.o: foo.p
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>The prerequisite on <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.p</SPAN></SAMP> does not necessarily mean that <CODE>make</CODE> will remake <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP> according to the implicit rule to make an object file, a <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.o</SPAN></SAMP> file, from a Pascal source file, a <SAMP><SPAN class=file>.p</SPAN></SAMP> file. For example, if <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> also exists, the implicit rule to make an object file from a C source file is used instead, because it appears before the Pascal rule in the list of predefined implicit rules (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Catalogue-of-Rules">Catalogue of Implicit Rules</A>).
