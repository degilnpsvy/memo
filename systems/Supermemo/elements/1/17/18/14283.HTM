The main use of <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> is <FONT class=clozed>in communication between recursive invocations of <CODE>make</CODE> (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion"><FONT class=clozed>Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>). It usually is not desirable to set the environment variable before a top-level invocation of <CODE>make</CODE>, because it is usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside. However, if you are running <CODE>make</CODE> without a specific makefile, a makefile in <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit rules work better, such as defining search paths (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search"><FONT class=clozed>Directory Search</FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>).</FONT>
