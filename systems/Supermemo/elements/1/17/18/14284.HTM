The <CODE>shell</CODE> function performs the same function that <FONT class=clozed>backquotes (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>`</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) perform in most shells: it does <DFN>command expansion</DFN></FONT>. This means that it takes as an argument a shell command and evaluates to <FONT class=clozed>the output of the command</FONT>. The only processing <CODE>make</CODE> does on the result is <FONT class=clozed>to convert each newline (or carriage-return / newline pair) to a single space. If there is a trailing (carriage-return and) newline it will simply be removed</FONT>.
