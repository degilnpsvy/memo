We start out with a look at some standard interfaces that can be used to build ports. Next, we discuss built-in specialized ports and their conveniences, especially with regard to static sensitivity. Finally, we present the concept of port arrays, and finish the chapter with a different type of port, sc_export&lt;T&gt;. </FONT></SPAN>
