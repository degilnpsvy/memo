<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>As we mentioned before, SCV provides extensions for all the built-in C/C++ and SystemC data types.In addition to the extension methods discussed so far, the template extensions also include operators that let you manipulate the extended objects as you would a built-in type. For example, you can use +=, &lt;&lt;=, *=, etc. on the extended data objects to perform simple operations. The template extensions also provide read() and write() functions to access the data.</FONT></SPAN>
