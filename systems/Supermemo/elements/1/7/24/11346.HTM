<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>In this chapter, we presented the OSCI TLM 1.0 standard, which defines a set of TLM API interfaces. We also presented some of the main components for TLM designs, including channels, initiator, target, router, and arbiter. With this knowledge, you are ready to design a TLM system-level model. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Before you start your design you may want to review the TLM methodology chapter earlier in the book. While we have focused on the &#8220;how&#8221; of TLM-based design in this chapter, the TLM methodology discussion earlier in the book discusses the &#8220;why&#8221; of TLM design and how it fits with project flow. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>It will become apparent, that while one design group may use this methodology for architectural exploration, another group may extend the design for another purpose, such as early software development. It is important to understand the usage model and create the system-level design to be flexible and to allow for different levels of abstraction. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Finally, keep in mind that the material in this chapter applies to the OSCI TLM 1.0 standard. The OSCI TLM Working Group is currently developing the TLM 2.0 standard. The updated standard is targeting improvements in the TLM APIs, adding generic data structures, and adding timing annotation capabilities. The API improvements and generic data structures will help greatly in model interoperability, and the timing annotation capabilities will allow faster simulations. We strongly encourage the reader to find out more on both the TLM 1.0 and planned features for TLM 2.0 on the OSCI SystemC site, www.systemc.org. </FONT></SPAN>
