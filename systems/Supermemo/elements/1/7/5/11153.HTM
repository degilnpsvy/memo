For these, the standard C++ struct and array are good starting points. However, a number of very useful data type classes are freely available in C++ libraries, which provides another benefit of having a modeling language based upon C++. </FONT></SPAN></P>

The STL contains many useful data types and structures, including an improved character array known as string, and generic containers such as the vector&lt;T&gt;, map&lt;T,T&gt;, set&lt;T&gt;, list&lt;T&gt;, and deque&lt;T&gt;. These containers can be manipulated by STL algorithms such as for_each(), count(), min_element(), max_element(), search(), transform(), reverse(), and sort(). These are just a few of the algorithms available.</FONT> This book will not attempt to cover the STL in any detail, but a brief example may stimulate you to search further. </FONT></SPAN></P>
