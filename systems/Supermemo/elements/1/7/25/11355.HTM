<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Depending on the stability of your model, you may want to consider looking at optimizing your use of the C++ compiler. Many times, default make scripts assume that the developer wants maximum debug visibility, and the compiler obliges with additional visibility that may affect simulation performance. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>When looking for maximum performance, make sure that your SystemC library and your system design are compiled without a debug option. Additionally, some compilers have switches that perform additional run-time optimizations at the expense of increased compile time. If you plan to run extensive simulation with the same model, it may pay to wade through the documentation for your compiler. Another example, ensuring that #ifndef is on the first line of a header file improves performance for some compilers. </FONT></SPAN>
