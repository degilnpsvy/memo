It&#8217;s a shame to not be spending $300-$1,000 for a potential 2x-3x performance gain. Similarly, why not increase the number of compute engines and run two, three, ten, or even hundreds of simulations at the same time. Compute farms are very effective for many types of modeling problems. </FONT></SPAN>
