<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Another interesting area for SystemC designers to watch is channels. Every channel interaction involves at least two calls (producer and consumer), two events, and possibly two copy operations. Hierarchical sc_port to sc_portconnections are very efficient because they simply pass a pointer to the target channel at elaboration. You will also find sc_export to sc_export hierarchical connections are similarly efficient. Another efficient way of communicating is sc_port to sc_export, since it can be implemented as a simple function call. If you find yourself writing a process that merely copies one port to another, consider the possibility of re-architecting the connectivity.</FONT></SPAN>
