<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Often designers tend to think in terms of the final implementation rather than the general problem being designed. This approach sometimes results in too much specification. For instance, a behavior may be specified as a finite state machine (FSM), when the real issue is simply a handshake or data transfer. Be careful when presented with myriads of detail to abstract the real needs of the design. </FONT></SPAN>
