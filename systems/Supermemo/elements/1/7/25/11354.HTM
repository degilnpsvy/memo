<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Keeping data native has already been discussed under data types earlier in the book, but this topic bears repeating. Data types are an abused subject. Does the model at hand really need to specify 17 bits, or would a simple int suffice? Native C++ data types will simulate many times faster than their SystemC hardware-specific counterparts. Similarly, what do you gain using sc_logic? Is the unknown value relevant to the current level of modeling? Once again, the issue is to model only those items that will affect the results of the simulation. </FONT></SPAN>
