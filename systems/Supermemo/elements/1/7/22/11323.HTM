<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>In Chapter 2, we introduced the concept of transaction-level modeling-based (TLM) methodology. In the chapter, we talked about some of the reasons why one would use a TLM methodology, including design exploration, early hardware/software integration, and early verification development. Clearly, any one of the above is a good reason to develop a TLM model. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>To implement a TLM methodology, there needs to be a precise definition of a TLM standard. This standard should be flexible enough to work at different levels of abstraction and be protocol-independent. Currently, there are various working groups defining a TLM specification. In this chapter, we will focus only on the Open SystemC Initiative (OSCI) TLM 1.0 standard, and we will provide a glimpse of objectives planned for the next release at the time of this writing. </FONT></SPAN>
