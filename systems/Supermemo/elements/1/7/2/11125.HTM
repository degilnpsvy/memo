<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>SystemC implements the structures necessary for hardware modeling by providing constructs that enable concepts of time, hardware data types, hierarchy and structure, communications, and concurrency. This section has presented an overview of SystemC relative to a generic set of requirements for hardware design. We will now give a brief overview of the constructs used to implement these requirements in SystemC.</FONT></SPAN>
