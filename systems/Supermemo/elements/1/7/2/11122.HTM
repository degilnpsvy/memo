<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Large designs are almost always broken down hierarchically to manage complexity, easing understanding of the design for the engineering team. SystemC provides several constructs for implementing hardware hierarchy. Hardware designs traditionally use blocks interconnected with wires or signals for this purpose. For modeling hardware hierarchy, SystemC uses the module entity interconnected to other modules using channels. The hierarchy comes from the instantiation of module classes within other modules. </FONT></SPAN>
