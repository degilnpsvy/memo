<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>The SystemC channel provides a powerful mechanism for modeling communications. Conceptually, a channel is more than a simple signal or wire. Channels can represent complex communications schemes that eventually map to significant hardware such as the AMBA bus[3See AMBA AHB Cycle-Level Interface Specification at www.arm.com.]. At the same time, channels may also represent very simple communications such as a wire or a FIFO (first-in &shy; first-out queue). </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>The ability to have several quite different channel implementations used interchangeably to connect modules is a very powerful feature. This feature enables an implementation of a simple bus replaced with a more detailed hardware implementation, which is eventually implemented with gates. </FONT></SPAN></P>

These built-in channels include locking mechanisms like mutex and semaphores, as well as hardware concepts like FIFOs, signals and others. </FONT></SPAN></P>
