<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;><FONT class=extract>SystemC&#8217;s primitive channels are known as primitive because they contain no hierarchy, no simulation processes, and are designed simple to be very fast.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>All primitive channels inherit from the base class sc_prim_channel. Because they are SystemC channels, they must also inherit from and implement one or more SystemC interface classes.</FONT> The SystemC library contains several built-in primitive channels. This chapter focuses on the simplest channels, sc_mutex, sc_semaphore, and sc_fifo&lt;T&gt;. Additional primitive channel topics will be discussed in later chapters. </FONT></SPAN>
