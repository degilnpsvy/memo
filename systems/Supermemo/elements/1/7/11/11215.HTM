<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Exercise 7.2: Modify your dynamic simulation process version of the turn_of_events example in Chapter 6 so that the turn_knob_thread and stop_signal_thread do not rely on the event names signal_stop, signal_off, stop_indicator_on, and stop_indicator_off. (Hint: Pass a reference to the appropriate events to the turn_know_thread and the stop_signal_thread simulation processes.) </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Exercise 7.3: As an advanced exercise, see if you can devise a classical software interrupt handler for a hardware environment that has two interrupts, a 1 us timer, and an incoming data packet. Assume data arrives randomly with separations of 500 ns to 2 us. This exercise is as much an exercise in planning as it is an exercise in using the syntax. Feel free to use the process controls if you have access to a SystemC version that supports it.</FONT></SPAN>
