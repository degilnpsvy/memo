<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>Thus far in this chapter, we have focused on the core TLM 1.0 APIs that define the communication between design components. We also covered some basic OSCI TLM channels that are provided as optional components to the TLM standard. In this section, we focus on the components you will need to model your designs. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>In many systems, designs typically contain multiple components including masters, slaves, routers, and arbiters. Regardless of function, each component is connected via a port/export pair, or through an intermediate channel. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><FONT face=&#23435;&#20307;>The OSCI TLM 1.0 kit provides documentation, working examples, and example components masters, slaves, an arbiter, and a router. These components and example configurations provide a base for developing your own TLM components. Developers new to SystemC should study these examples closely; some features are subtle such as model connectivity and the use of specialized ports for detail abstraction. Developers would be well served, if they created their own block diagrams to trace model connectivity, and review the previous chapter on specialized ports.</FONT></SPAN>
