<p><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 15pt; COLOR: black; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-font-kerning: 0pt">TLM-2.0 does not make explicit provision for an untimed coding style, because all contemporary bus-based systems require some notion of time in order to model software running on one or more embedded processors. However, untimed modeling is supported by the TLM-1 core interfaces. (The term <I>untimed </I>is sometimes used to refer to models that contain a limited amount of timing information of unspecified accuracy. In TLM-2.0, such models would be termed loosely-timed.) </SPAN>
