a level of variable indirection is introduced. Bash uses the value of the variable formed from the rest of <VAR>parameter</VAR> as the name of the variable; this variable is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the substitution, rather than the value of <VAR>parameter</VAR> itself. This is known as <CODE>indirect expansion</CODE>. The exceptions to this are the expansions of ${!<VAR>prefix</VAR><BR>} and ${!<VAR>name</VAR>[@]} described below. The exclamation point must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.
