Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows: 
<P></P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>$(<VAR>command</VAR>)
</FONT></PRE></DIV>
<P><FONT class=clozed>or </FONT></P>
<DIV class=example><PRE class=example><FONT class=clozed>`<VAR>command</VAR>`</FONT>
</PRE></DIV>
<P>Bash performs the expansion by executing <VAR>command</VAR> and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.
