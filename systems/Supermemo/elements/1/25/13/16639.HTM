When the old-style backquote form of substitution is used (`<VAR>command</VAR>`), backslash retains its literal meaning except <FONT class=clozed>when followed by &#8216;<SAMP>$</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>`</SAMP>&#8217;, or &#8216;<SAMP>\</SAMP>&#8217;</FONT>. The first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command substitution. 
<P></P>
<P>When using the <CODE>$(<VAR>command</VAR>)</CODE> form, all characters between the parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.
