The basic form of parameter expansion is ${<VAR>parameter</VAR>}. The value of <VAR>parameter</VAR> is substituted. The braces are required when <VAR>parameter</VAR> is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when <VAR>parameter</VAR> is followed by a character that is not to be interpreted as part of its name.
