<PRE class=example>$(foreach dir,$(dirs),$(wildcard $(dir)/*))
</PRE>
<P>Here <VAR>text</VAR> is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(wildcard $(dir)/*)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. The first repetition finds the value &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>a</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; for <CODE>dir</CODE>, so it produces the same result as &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(wildcard a/*)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; the second repetition produces the result of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(wildcard b/*)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; and the third, that of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$(wildcard c/*)</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;.
