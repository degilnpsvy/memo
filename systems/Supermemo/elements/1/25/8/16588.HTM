If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number <VAR>N</VAR>, optionally prefixed by a &#8216;<SAMP>+</SAMP>&#8217; or a &#8216;<SAMP>-</SAMP>&#8217;, the tilde-prefix is replaced with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be displayed by the <CODE>dirs</CODE> builtin invoked with the characters following tilde in the tilde-prefix as an argument (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Directory-Stack.html#The-Directory-Stack">The Directory Stack</A>). If the tilde-prefix, sans the tilde, consists of a number without a leading &#8216;<SAMP>+</SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP>-</SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP>+</SAMP>&#8217; is assumed.
