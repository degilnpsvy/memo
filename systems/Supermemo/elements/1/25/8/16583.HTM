Sometimes makefiles can be remade from other files, such as RCS or SCCS files. If a makefile can be remade from other files, you probably want <CODE>make</CODE> to get an up-to-date version of the makefile to read in. 
<P>To this end, after reading in all makefiles, <CODE>make</CODE> will consider each as a goal target and attempt to update it. If a makefile has a rule which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile or in another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</A>), it will be updated if necessary. After all makefiles have been checked, if any have actually been changed, <CODE>make</CODE> starts with a clean slate and reads all the makefiles over again. (It will also attempt to update each of them over again, but normally this will not change them again, since they are already up to date.)
