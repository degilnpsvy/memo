If you know that one or more of your makefiles cannot be remade and you want to keep <CODE>make</CODE> from performing an implicit rule search on them, perhaps for efficiency reasons, you can use any normal method of preventing implicit rule look-up to do so. For example, you can write an explicit rule with the makefile as the target, and an empty recipe (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Recipes">Using Empty Recipes</A>).
