Each variable assignment is checked for <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> tilde-prefixes immediately following a &#8216;<SAMP>:</SAMP>&#8217; or the first &#8216;<SAMP>=</SAMP>&#8217;. In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed. Consequently, one may use file names with tildes in assignments to <CODE>PATH</CODE>, <CODE>MAILPATH</CODE>, and <CODE>CDPATH</CODE>, and the shell assigns the expanded value.
