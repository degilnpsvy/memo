Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. Command substitution occurs when a command is enclosed as follows: 
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN><BR></P>
<P>Bash performs the expansion by executing <VAR>command</VAR> and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.
