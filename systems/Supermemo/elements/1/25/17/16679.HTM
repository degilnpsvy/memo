<P>The <VAR>word</VAR> is expanded to produce a pattern just as in filename expansion (see <A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Filename-Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion">Filename Expansion</A>). If the pattern matches the beginning of the expanded value of <VAR>parameter</VAR>, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of <VAR>parameter</VAR> with the shortest matching pattern (the &#8216;<SAMP>#</SAMP>&#8217; case) or the longest matching pattern (the &#8216;<SAMP>##</SAMP>&#8217; case) deleted. </P>

<P>If <VAR>parameter</VAR> is &#8216;<SAMP>@</SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP>*</SAMP>&#8217;, <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. </P>
<DD>
<P>If <VAR>parameter</VAR> is an array variable subscripted with &#8216;<SAMP>@</SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP>*</SAMP>&#8217;, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.</P></DD>
