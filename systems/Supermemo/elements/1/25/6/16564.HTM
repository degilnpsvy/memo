There are four levels of granularity when synchronizing output, specified by giving an argument to the option (e.g., &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-Oline</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--output-sync=recurse</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;).

<DT><FONT class=clozed><CODE>none</CODE> </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=clozed>This is the default: all output is sent directly as it is generated and no synchronization is performed. <BR></FONT>
<DT><FONT class=clozed><CODE>line</CODE> </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=clozed>Output from each individual line of the recipe is grouped and printed as soon as that line is complete. If a recipe consists of multiple lines, they may be interspersed with lines from other recipes. <BR></FONT>
<DT><FONT class=clozed><CODE>target</CODE> </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=clozed>Output from the entire recipe for each target is grouped and printed once the target is complete. This is the default if the <CODE>--output-sync</CODE> or <CODE>-O</CODE> option is given with no argument. <BR></FONT>
<DT><FONT class=clozed><CODE>recurse</CODE> </FONT>
<DD><FONT class=clozed>Output from each recursive invocation of <CODE>make</CODE> is grouped and printed once the recursive invocation is complete. </FONT></DD></DL>
