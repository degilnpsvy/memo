When running several recipes in parallel the output from each recipe appears as soon as it is generated, with the result that messages from different recipes may be interspersed, sometimes even appearing on the same line. This can make reading the output very difficult.

This option instructs <CODE>make</CODE> to save the output from the commands it invokes and print it all once the commands are completed. Additionally, if there are multiple recursive <CODE>make</CODE> invocations running in parallel, they will communicate so that only one of them is generating output at a time.
