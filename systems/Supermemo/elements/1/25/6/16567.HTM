When the system is heavily loaded, you will probably want to run fewer jobs than when it is lightly loaded. You can use the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option to tell <CODE>make</CODE> to limit the number of jobs to run at once, based on the load average. The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--max-load</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option is followed by a floating-point number. For example, <PRE class=example>     -l 2.5
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>will not let <CODE>make</CODE> start more than one job if the load average is above 2.5. The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option with no following number removes the load limit, if one was given with a previous &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option. 
<P>More precisely, when <CODE>make</CODE> goes to start up a job, and it already has at least one job running, it checks the current load average; if it is not lower than the limit given with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-l</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, <CODE>make</CODE> waits until the load average goes below that limit, or until all the other jobs finish.
