The <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> variable can also be useful if you want to have certain options, such as &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-k</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</A>), set each time you run <CODE>make</CODE>. You simply put a value for <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in your environment. You can also set <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> in a makefile, to specify additional flags that should also be in effect for that makefile. (Note that you cannot use <CODE>MFLAGS</CODE> this way. That variable is set only for compatibility; <CODE>make</CODE> does not interpret a value you set for it in any way.)
