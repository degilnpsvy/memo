When <CODE>make</CODE> interprets the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> (either from the environment or from a makefile), it first prepends a hyphen if the value does not already begin with one. Then it chops the value into words separated by blanks, and parses these words as if they were options given on the command line (except that &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-C</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-f</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-h</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-o</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-W</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, and their long-named versions are ignored; and there is no error for an invalid option).
