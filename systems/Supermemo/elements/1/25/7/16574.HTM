<H3 class=section>7.3 Conditionals that Test Flags</H3>
<P>You can write a conditional that tests <CODE>make</CODE> command flags such as &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; by using the variable <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> together with the <CODE>findstring</CODE> function (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Text-Functions">Functions for String Substitution and Analysis</A>). This is useful when <CODE>touch</CODE> is not enough to make a file appear up to date. 
<P>The <CODE>findstring</CODE> function determines whether one string appears as a substring of another. If you want to test for the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag, use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; as the first string and the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> as the other. 
<P>For example, here is how to arrange to use &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>ranlib -t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; to finish marking an archive file up to date: <PRE class=example><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></PRE><PRE class=example><SPAN class=cloze></SPAN>The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; prefix marks those recipe lines as &#8220;recursive&#8221; so that they will be executed despite use of the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; flag. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>.</PRE>
