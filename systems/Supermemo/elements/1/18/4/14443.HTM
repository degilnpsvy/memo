The syntax of the <CODE>foreach</CODE> function is: <PRE class=example>     <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>The first two arguments, <VAR>var</VAR> and <VAR>list</VAR>, are expanded before anything else is done; note that the last argument, <VAR>text</VAR>, is <STRONG>not</STRONG> expanded at the same time. Then for each word of the expanded value of <VAR>list</VAR>, the variable named by the expanded value of <VAR>var</VAR> is set to that word, and <VAR>text</VAR> is expanded. Presumably <VAR>text</VAR> contains references to that variable, so its expansion will be different each time. 
<P>The result is that <VAR>text</VAR> is expanded as many times as there are whitespace-separated words in <VAR>list</VAR>. The multiple expansions of <VAR>text</VAR> are concatenated, with spaces between them, to make the result of <CODE>foreach</CODE>.
