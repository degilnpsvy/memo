the third rule will be chosen since the stem for this rule (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>bar</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;) is shorter than the stem for the first rule (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>lib/bar</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;). If <SAMP><SPAN class=file>lib/bar.c</SPAN></SAMP> does not exist then the third rule is not eligible and the second rule will be used, even though the stem is longer.
