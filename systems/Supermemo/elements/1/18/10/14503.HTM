<FONT class=extract>If your operating system doesn't support the above communication (If you set it to some numeric value &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>N</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and your operating system supports it (most any UNIX system will; others typically won't), the parent <CODE>make</CODE> and all the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s will communicate to ensure that there are only &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>N</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; jobs running at the same time between them all.), then &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-j 1</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is always put into <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> instead of the value you specified.</FONT> This is because if the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-j</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w --> option were passed down to sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s, you would get many more jobs running in parallel than you asked for. <FONT class=extract>If you give &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-j</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; with no numeric argument, meaning to run as many jobs as possible in parallel, this is passed down, since multiple infinities are no more than one.</FONT>
