If you do not want to pass the other flags down, you must change the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE>, like this: <PRE class=example>     subsystem:
             cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)<FONT class=clozed> MAKEFLAGS=
</FONT></PRE>
<P><A name=index-MAKEOVERRIDES-436></A>The command line variable definitions really appear in the variable <CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE>, and <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> contains a reference to this variable. If you do want to pass flags down normally, but don't want to pass down the command line variable definitions, you can reset <CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE> to empty, like this: <PRE class=example>     MAKEOVERRIDES =
</PRE>
<P class=noindent><A name=index-Arg-list-too-long-437></A><A name=index-E2BIG-438></A>This is not usually useful to do. However, some systems have a small fixed limit on the size of the environment, and putting so much information into the value of <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> can exceed it. If you see the error message &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>Arg list too long</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, this may be the problem. <A name=index-g_t_002ePOSIX-439></A><A name=index-POSIX-440></A>(For strict compliance with POSIX.2, changing <CODE>MAKEOVERRIDES</CODE> does not affect <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> if the special target &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.POSIX</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; appears in the makefile. You probably do not care about this.)
