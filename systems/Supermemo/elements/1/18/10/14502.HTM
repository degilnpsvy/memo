The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-j</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option is a special case (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Parallel">Parallel Execution</A>). If you set it to some numeric value &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>N</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and your operating system supports it (most any UNIX system will; others typically won't), the parent <CODE>make</CODE> and all the sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s will communicate to ensure that there are only &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>N</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; jobs running at the same time between them all. Note that any job that is marked recursive (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution">Instead of Executing Recipes</A>) doesn't count against the total jobs (otherwise we could get &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>N</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; sub-<CODE>make</CODE>s running and have no slots left over for any real work!)
