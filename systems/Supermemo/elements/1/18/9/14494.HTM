There are some special implicit rules to optimize certain cases that would otherwise be handled by rule chains. For example, making <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> from <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP> could be handled by compiling and linking with separate chained rules, using <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP> as an intermediate file. But what actually happens is that <FONT class=clozed>a special rule for this case does the compilation and linking with a single <CODE>cc</CODE> command. The optimized rule is used in preference to the step-by-step chain because it comes earlier in the ordering of rules.</FONT>
