<FONT class=extract>Normally <CODE>make</CODE> prints each line of the recipe before it is executed. We call this <DFN>echoing</DFN> because it gives the appearance that you are typing the lines yourself.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract>When a line starts with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, the echoing of that line is suppressed. The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is discarded before the line is passed to the shell.</FONT>
