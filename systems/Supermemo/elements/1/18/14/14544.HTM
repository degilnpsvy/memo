No single implicit rule can appear more than once in a chain. This means that <CODE>make</CODE> will not even consider such a ridiculous thing as making <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo</SPAN></SAMP> from <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o.o</SPAN></SAMP> by running the linker twice. This constraint has the added benefit of preventing any infinite loop in the search for an implicit rule chain.
