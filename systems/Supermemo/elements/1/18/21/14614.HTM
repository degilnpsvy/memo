The <CODE>eval</CODE> function is very special: <FONT class=clozed>it allows you to define new makefile constructs that are not constant; which are the result of evaluating other variables and functions. The argument to the <CODE>eval</CODE> function is expanded, then the results of that expansion are parsed as makefile syntax. The expanded results can define new <CODE>make</CODE> variables, targets, implicit or explicit rules, etc.</FONT>
