When <CODE>make</CODE> is given the flag <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>it only echoes most recipes, without executing them. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</A>. In this case even the recipe lines starting with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; are printed. This flag is useful for finding out which recipes <CODE>make</CODE> thinks are necessary without actually doing them.
