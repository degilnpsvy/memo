determining the <DFN>default goal</DFN>: the target for <CODE>make</CODE> to consider, if you do not otherwise specify one. The default goal is the target of the first rule in the first makefile. If the first rule has multiple targets, only the first target is taken as the default. There are two exceptions: ?a target starting with a period is not a default unless it contains one or more slashes, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>/</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, as well; and, a target that defines a pattern rule has no effect on the default goal?. (See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules">Defining and Redefining Pattern Rules</A>.)
