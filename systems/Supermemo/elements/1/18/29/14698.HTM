in communication between recursive invocations of <CODE>make</CODE> (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <CODE>make</CODE></A>). It usually is not desirable to set the environment variable before a top-level invocation of <CODE>make</CODE>, because it is usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside. However, if you are running <CODE>make</CODE> without a specific makefile, a makefile in <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit rules work better, such as defining search paths (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Directory-Search">Directory Search</A>).
