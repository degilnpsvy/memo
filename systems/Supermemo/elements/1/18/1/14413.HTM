This is done if the target file's last-modification time has changed since <CODE>make</CODE> first checked it.</FONT> 
<P>The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from scratch when <CODE>make</CODE> is next run. Why is this? Suppose you type <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an object file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP>. The <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> kills the compiler, resulting in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source file <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.c</SPAN></SAMP>. But <CODE>make</CODE> also receives the <KBD>Ctrl-c</KBD> signal and deletes this incomplete file. If <CODE>make</CODE> did not do this, the next invocation of <CODE>make</CODE> would think that <SAMP><SPAN class=file>foo.o</SPAN></SAMP> did not require updating&#8212;resulting in a strange error message from the linker when it tries to link an object file half of which is missing. 
<P><A name=index-g_t_002ePRECIOUS-384></A>You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the special target <CODE><FONT class=clozed>.PRECIOUS</FONT></CODE> depend on it. Before remaking a target, <CODE>make</CODE> checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of <CODE>.PRECIOUS</CODE>, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted if a signal happens. Some reasons why you might do this are that <FONT class=clozed>the target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all times to prevent other sorts of trouble</FONT>.
