<P><A name=index-MAKE-390></A><A name=index-recursion_002c-and-_0040code_007bMAKE_007d-variable-391></A><FONT class=extract>Recursive <CODE>make</CODE> commands should always use the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>, not the explicit command name &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;</FONT>, as shown here: <PRE class=example>     subsystem:
             cd subdir &amp;&amp; $(MAKE)
</PRE>
<P>The value of this variable is the file name with which <CODE>make</CODE> was invoked. If this file name was <SAMP><SPAN class=file>/bin/make</SPAN></SAMP>, then the recipe executed is &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>cd subdir &amp;&amp; /bin/make</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. If you use a special version of <CODE>make</CODE> to run the top-level makefile, the same special version will be executed for recursive invocations. <A name=index-g_t_0040code_007bcd_007d-_0028shell-command_0029-392></A><A name=index-g_t_002b_002c-and-recipes-393></A><FONT class=extract>As a special feature, using the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE> in the recipe of a rule alters the effects of the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--touch</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;), &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-n</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--just-print</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;), or &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-q</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>--question</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;<!-- /@w -->) option.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>Using the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable has the same effect as using a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; character at the beginning of the recipe line. See </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution"><FONT class=extract>Instead of Executing the Recipes</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>. This special feature is only enabled if the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable appears directly in the recipe: it does not apply if the <CODE>MAKE</CODE> variable is referenced through expansion of another variable. In the latter case you must use the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>+</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; token to get these special effects.</FONT> 
<P><FONT class=extract>Consider the command &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; in the above example. (The &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; option marks targets as up to date without actually running any recipes; see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Instead-of-Execution"><FONT class=extract>Instead of Execution</FONT></A><FONT class=extract>.) Following the usual definition of &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, a &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make -t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; command in the example would create a file named <SAMP><SPAN class=file>subsystem</SPAN></SAMP> and do nothing else. What you really want it to do is run &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>cd&nbsp;subdir&nbsp;&amp;&amp;<!-- /@w --> make&nbsp;-t<!-- /@w --></SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;; but that would require executing the recipe, and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; says not to execute recipes. </FONT><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dt_007d_002c-and-recursion-394></A><A name=index-recursion_002c-and-_0040code_007b_002dt_007d-395></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dtouch_007d_002c-and-recursion-396></A><FONT class=extract>The special feature makes this do what you want: whenever a recipe line of a rule contains the variable <CODE>MAKE</CODE>, the flags &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-t</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-n</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; and &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>-q</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; do not apply to that line. Recipe lines containing <CODE>MAKE</CODE> are executed normally despite the presence of a flag that causes most recipes not to be run. The usual <CODE>MAKEFLAGS</CODE> mechanism passes the flags to the sub-<CODE>make</CODE> (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Options_002fRecursion"><FONT class=extract>Communicating Options to a Sub-<CODE>make</CODE></FONT></A><FONT class=extract>), so your request to touch the files, or print the recipes, is propagated to the subsystem.</FONT>
