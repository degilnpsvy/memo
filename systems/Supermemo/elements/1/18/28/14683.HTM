If the environment variable <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> is defined, <CODE>make</CODE> considers its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of additional makefiles to be read before the others. This works much like the <CODE>include</CODE> directive: various directories are searched for those files (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</A>). In addition, the default goal is never taken from one of these makefiles (or any makefile included by them) and it is not an error if the files listed in <CODE>MAKEFILES</CODE> are not found.
