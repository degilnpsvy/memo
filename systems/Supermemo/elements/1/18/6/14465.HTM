Wildcards are also useful in the prerequisites of a rule. With the following rule in the makefile, &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>make print</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; will print all the &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>.c</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; files that have changed since the last time you printed them: 
<P></P><PRE class=example>     print: *.c
             lpr -p $?
             touch print
</PRE>
<P><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007bprint_007d-target-160></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007blpr_007d-_0028shell-command_0029-161></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007btouch_007d-_0028shell-command_0029-162></A>This rule uses <SAMP><SPAN class=file>print</SPAN></SAMP> as an empty target file; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Targets">Empty Target Files to Record Events</A>. (The automatic variable &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$?</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is used to print only those files that have changed; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Automatic-Variables">Automatic Variables</A>.)
