GNU <CODE>make</CODE> allows only one recipe to be specified per target (except for double-colon rules). If you give a recipe for a target which already has been defined to have one, this warning is issued and the second recipe will overwrite the first. See <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Multiple-Rules">Multiple Rules for One Target</A>.
