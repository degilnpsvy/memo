Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but you don't want the backslash/newline to appear in the quoted content. This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl, where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning or even be a syntax error. One simple way of handling this is to place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a <CODE>make</CODE> variable then use the variable in the recipe. In this situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and the backslash/newline will be removed. If we rewrite our example above using this method: <PRE class=example>     HELLO = 'hello \
     world'
     
     all : ; @echo $(HELLO)
</PRE>
<P class=noindent>we will get output like this: <PRE class=example>     <FONT class=clozed>hello world
</FONT></PRE>
