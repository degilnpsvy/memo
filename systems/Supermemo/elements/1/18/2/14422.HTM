Each line in the recipe must start with a tab (or the first character in the value of the <CODE>.RECIPEPREFIX</CODE> variable; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Special Variables</A>), except that the first recipe line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a semicolon in between. <EM>Any</EM> line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a &#8220;rule context&#8221; (that is, after a rule has been started until another rule or variable definition) will be considered part of a recipe for that rule. Blank lines and lines of just comments may appear among the recipe lines; they are ignored.
