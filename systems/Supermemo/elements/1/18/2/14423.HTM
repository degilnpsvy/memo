Some consequences of these rules include: 
<UL>
<LI>A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it's an empty recipe (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Empty-Recipes">Empty Recipes</A>). 
<P><A name=index-comments_002c-in-recipes-294></A><A name=index-recipes_002c-comments-in-295></A><A name=index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023_007d-_0028comments_0029_002c-in-recipes-296></A></P>
<LI>A comment in a recipe is not a <CODE>make</CODE> comment; it will be passed to the shell as-is. Whether the shell treats it as a comment or not depends on your shell. 
<LI>A variable definition in a &#8220;rule context&#8221; which is indented by a tab as the first character on the line, will be considered part of a recipe, not a <CODE>make</CODE> variable definition, and passed to the shell. 
<LI>A conditional expression (<CODE>ifdef</CODE>, <CODE>ifeq</CODE>, etc. see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Conditional-Syntax">Syntax of Conditionals</A>) in a &#8220;rule context&#8221; which is indented by a tab as the first character on the line, will be considered part of a recipe and be passed to the shell.</LI></UL>
