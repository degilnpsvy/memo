Makefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct syntaxes in one file: <FONT class=clozed>Most of the makefile uses <CODE>make</CODE> syntax (see </FONT><A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Makefiles"><FONT class=clozed>Writing Makefiles</FONT></A><FONT class=clozed>). However, recipes are meant to be interpreted by the shell and so they are written using shell syntax.</FONT>
