Variable and function references in recipes have identical syntax and semantics to references elsewhere in the makefile. They also have the same quoting rules: if you want a dollar sign to appear in your recipe, you must <FONT class=clozed>double it (&#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>$$</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;). For shells like the default shell, that use dollar signs to introduce variables, it's important to keep clear in your mind whether the variable you want to reference is a <CODE>make</CODE> variable (use a single dollar sign) or a shell variable (use two dollar signs).</FONT>
