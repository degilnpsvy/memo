However, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a makefile (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Splitting-Lines">Splitting Long Lines</A>), backslash/newline pairs are <EM><FONT class=clozed>not</FONT></EM> removed from the recipe. Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved and passed to the shell. How the backslash/newline is interpreted depends on your shell. If the first character of the next line after the backslash/newline is the recipe prefix character (a tab by default; see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Variables">Special Variables</A>), then that character (and only that character) is removed. Whitespace is never added to the recipe.
