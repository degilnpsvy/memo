The <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> flag to <CODE>make</CODE> prevents all echoing, as if all recipes started with &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217;. A rule in the makefile for the special target <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> without prerequisites has the same effect (see <A href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Special-Targets">Special Built-in Target Names</A>). <CODE>.SILENT</CODE> is essentially obsolete since &#8216;<SAMP><SPAN class=samp>@</SPAN></SAMP>&#8217; is more flexible.
