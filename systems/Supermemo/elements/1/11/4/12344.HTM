<SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-o</SPAN> (for <SPAN class=docEmphBold>latex-insert-block</SPAN>). Emacs prompts for the block name, and then for associated options. For example, type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-c C-o Enter</SPAN> <SPAN class=docEmphBold>document Enter Enter</SPAN> (the second <SPAN class=docEmphBold>Enter</SPAN> indicates no options). Emacs inserts the command pair and positions the cursor between them
