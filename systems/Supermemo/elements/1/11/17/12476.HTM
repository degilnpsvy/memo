<P class=docText>Note that <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-n</SPAN> and <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-p</SPAN> do not visit the source code corresponding to the error message; they simply allow you to move easily through error messages that may take up more than one line each. However, you can visit the source code from any error message by typing <SPAN class=docEmphBold><FONT class=clozed>C-c C-c</FONT></SPAN>.
