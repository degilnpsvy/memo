If you choose to rebase rather than merge, Git will instead forward port the changes on your local-tracking topic branch to the newly fetched HEAD of the corresponding remote- tracking branch. The operation is the same as that shown in Figure 10-12 and Figure 10-13 in Chapter 10. 
<P></P>
<P>The command git pull --rebase will cause Git to rebase (rather than merge) your local-tracking branch onto the remote-tracking branch during only this pull. To make rebase the normal operation for a branch, set the branch.branch_name.rebase configuration variable to true:</P>
<P>[branch "mydev"] </P>
<P>remote = origin </P>
<P>merge = refs/heads/master </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> </P>
<P>And with that, the merge (or rebase) step is also done.
