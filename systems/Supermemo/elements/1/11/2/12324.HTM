The bandwidth is decent though &#8211; up to about <FONT class=clozed>8GB/s</FONT> (theoretical) peak aggregate bandwidth across the <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> connections that most GPUs use right now, so between half and a third of the aggregate CPU memory bandwidth; that&#8217;s a usable ratio. And unlike earlier standards like AGP, this is a symmetrical point-to-point link &#8211; that bandwidth goes both directions; AGP had a fast channel from the CPU to the GPU, but not the other way round.
