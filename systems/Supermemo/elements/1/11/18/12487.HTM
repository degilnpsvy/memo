<P class=docText>The <SPAN class=docEmphBold>compile</SPAN> package also <A name=gnu3-CHP-9-ITERM-2530></A>includes similar support for the Unix <SPAN class=docEmphBold>grep</SPAN> (search files) command, thus effectively giving Emacs a multifile search capability. If you type <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>, you are prompted for arguments to send to <SPAN class=docEmphBold>grep</SPAN>&#8212;that is, a search pattern and filename(s). Emacs runs <SPAN class=docEmphBold>grep</SPAN> with the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>-n</SPAN> option, which tells it to print filenames and line numbers of matching lines.<SUP class=docFootnote><A class=docLink href="file:///D:/&#25105;&#30340;&#37239;&#30424;/&#24037;&#20316;&#30446;&#24405;/Now/learning-gnu-emacs-3rd/0596006489/gnu3-chp-9-sect-1.html#gnu3-chp-9-fnote-3">[3]</A></SUP> The same happens as with <SPAN class=docEmphBold>M-x compile</SPAN>; you can type <SPAN class=docEmphBold>C-x `</SPAN> to have Emacs visit the next matched line in its file.</P>

<P class=docFootnote><SUP><A name=gnu3-CHP-9-FNOTE-3>[3]</A></SUP> If <SPAN class=docEmphBold>grep -n</SPAN> is run on only one file, it just prints line numbers; Emacs forces it to print the filename as well in this case by appending the dummy file <SPAN class=docEmphasis>/dev/null</SPAN> to the <SPAN class=docEmphBold>grep</SPAN> command.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
