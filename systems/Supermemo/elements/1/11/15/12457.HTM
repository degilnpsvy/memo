Static sensitivity is implemented by applying the SystemC sensitive command to an SC_METHOD or SC_THREAD at elaboration time (within the constructor). Dynamic sensitivity lets a simulation process change its sensitivity on the fly. The SC_METHOD implements dynamic sensitivity with a next_trigger(arg) command. The SC_THREAD implements dynamic sensitivity with a wait(arg) command. Both SC_METHOD and SC_THREAD <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> switch between dynamic and static sensitivity during simulation.</FONT></SPAN>
