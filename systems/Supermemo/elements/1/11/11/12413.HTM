<P>* master </P>
<P>origin/HEAD </P>
<P>origin/master</P>
<P>The master branch is Bob&#8217;s main development branch. It is the normal, local topic branch. It is also a local-tracking branch associated with the correspondingly named master remote-tracking branch. The origin/master branch is a remote-tracking branch to follow the commits from the master branch of the origin repository. The origin/HEAD ref indicates <FONT class=clozed>which branch the remote considers the active branch, through a symbolic name</FONT>. Finally, the asterisk next to the master branch name indicates that it is the current, checked-out branch in his repository.
