The Unix diff command can compute the differences of all pairs of files found in two directory hierarchies. The command diff -r traverses each hierarchy in tandem, twins files by pathname (say, original/src/main.c and new/src/main.c), and summarizes the differences between each pair. <FONT class=extract>Using diff -r -u produces a set of unified diffs comparing two hierarchies.</FONT>
