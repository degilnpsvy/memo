But how did Git know to merge those particular branches? The answer comes from the configuration file: 
<P></P>
<P>[branch "master"] </P>
<P>remote = origin </P>
<P>merge = refs/heads/master</P>
<P>The value of the merge field in the branch section of the configuration file (refs/heads/ master) is treated like <FONT class=clozed>the remote part of a refspec, and it must match one of the source refs just fetched during the git pull command. It&#8217;s a little convoluted, but think of this as a hint conveyed from the fetch step to the merge step of a pull command.</FONT>
