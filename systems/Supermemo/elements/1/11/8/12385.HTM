But how did Git know to merge those particular branches? The answer comes from the configuration file: 
<P></P>
<P>[branch "master"] </P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>remote = origin </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>merge = refs/heads/master</FONT></P>
<P>For readers paying close attention to detail, the first part of that paraphrase is the actual mechanism by which Git determines that origin should be the remote used during this parameterless git pull command.
