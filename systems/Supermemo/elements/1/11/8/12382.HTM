The complete contents of the configuration file after a default clone show how it contains the origin remote: 
<P></P>
<P>$ cat .git/config </P>
<P>[core] </P>
<P>repositoryformatversion = 0 </P>
<P>filemode = true </P>
<P>bare = false </P>
<P>logallrefupdates = true </P>
<P>[remote "origin"] </P>
<P>url = /tmp/Depot/public_html.git </P>
<P>fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* </P>
<P>[branch "master"] </P>
<P>remote = origin </P>
<P>merge = refs/heads/master </P>
<P>In addition to having the origin remote in his repository, Bob also has a few branches. He can list all of the branches in his repository by using git branch-a:</P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ git branch -a </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>* master </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>origin/HEAD </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>origin/master</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The master branch is Bob&#8217;s main development branch. It is the normal, local topic branch. It is also a local-tracking branch associated with the correspondingly named master remote-tracking branch. The origin/master branch is a remote-tracking branch to follow the commits from the master branch of the origin repository. The origin/HEAD ref indicates which branch the remote considers the active branch, through a symbolic name. Finally, the asterisk next to the master branch name indicates that it is the current, checked-out branch in his repository.</FONT>
