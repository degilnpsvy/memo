I have a set of different texts i want to paste frequently. Is there a way to use like multiple clipboards? 
<P></P>
<P>Select the region, then call copy-to-register &#12304;<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>&#12305;, </P>
<P>give it a single character name as &#8220;1&#8221; or &#8220;a&#8221;. To paste it, call insert-register &#12304;Ctrl+x r i&#12305;.~
