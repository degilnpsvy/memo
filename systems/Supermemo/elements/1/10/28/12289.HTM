In git show-branch: 
<P></P>
<P>Stopping at the first common commit is the default heuristic for reasonable behavior. It is presumed that reaching such a common point yields sufficient context to understand how the branches relate to each other. If for some reason you actually want more commit history, use the<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> option, specifying the number of additional commits you want to see going back in time along the common branch.
