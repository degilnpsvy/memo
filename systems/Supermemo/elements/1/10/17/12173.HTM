Org can select items based on various criteria and display them in a separate buffer. Seven different view types are provided: 
<P></P>
<P>an <FONT class=clozed>agenda</FONT> that is like a calendar and shows information for specific dates, </P>
<P>a <FONT class=clozed>TODO list</FONT> that covers all unfinished action items, </P>
<P>a <FONT class=clozed>match view</FONT>, showings headlines based on the tags, properties, and TODO state associated with them, </P>
<P>a <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> that shows all events in a single Org file, in time-sorted view, </P>
<P>a text search view that shows all entries from multiple files that contain specified keywords, </P>
<P>a stuck projects view showing projects that currently don't move along, </P>
<P>and custom views that are special searches and combinations of different views.~
