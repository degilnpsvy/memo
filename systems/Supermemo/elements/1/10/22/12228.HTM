git diff 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>git diff shows the difference between your working directory and the index.</FONT> It exposes what is dirty in your working directory and is thus a candidate to stage for your next commit. This command does not reveal differences between what&#8217;s in your index and what&#8217;s permanently stored in the repository (not to mention remote repositories you might be working with).
