Let&#8217;s look at the diff in detail. In the header, the original file is denoted by <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> and the new file by <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. The @@ line provides line number context for both file versions. A line prefixed with a minus sign (&#8211;) must be removed from the original file to produce the new file. Conversely, a line with a leading plus sign (+) must be added to the original file to produce the new file. A line that begins with a space is the same in both files and is provided by the -u option as context.
