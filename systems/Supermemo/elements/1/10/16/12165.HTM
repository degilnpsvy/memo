In these images, the u=0 (yellow) edge has a TF of 2, the v=0 (green) edge has a TF of 3, the u=1 / w=0 (pink) edge has a TF of 4, and the v=1 (quad only, cyan) edge has a TF of 5 &#8211; exactly the number of vertices along the corresponding outer edge. As should be obvious from these two images, the basic building block for topology is just a nice way to stitch two subdivided edges with different number of vertices to each other. The details of this are somewhat tricky, but not particularly interesting, so I won&#8217;t go into it.</SPAN>

<P><SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As for the inside TFs, quads are fairly easy: The quad above has an inside TF of 3 along u and 4 along v. The geometry is basically that of a regular grid of that size, except with the first and last rows/columns replaced by the respective stitching triangles (if any edge has a TF of 1, the resulting mesh will have the same structure as if the inside TFs for u/v were both 2, even if they&#8217;re smaller than that). Triangles are a bit more complicated. Odd TFs we&#8217;ve already seen &#8211; for a TF of&nbsp;N, they produce a mesh consisting of&nbsp;(N+1)/2 concentric rings, the innermost of which is a single triangle. For even TFs, we get&nbsp;N/2&nbsp;concentric rings with a center vertex instead of a center triangle. Below is an image of the simplest even case,&nbsp;N = 2, which consists just of edge stitches plus the center vertex.</SPAN>

This is simply to ensure maximum rotational symmetry of the resulting meshes &#8211; if there&#8217;s extra degrees of freedom, might as well use them!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P></SPAN>
