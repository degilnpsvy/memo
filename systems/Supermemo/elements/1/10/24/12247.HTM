You know, the one that the hardware actually consumes. <FONT class=extract>The command buffers that the UMD produces aren&#8217;t the real deal &#8211; as a matter of fact, they&#8217;re just random slices of GPU-addressable memory.</FONT> What actually happens with them is that the UMD finishes them, submits them to the scheduler, which then waits until that process is up and then passes the UMD command buffer on to the KMD. The KMD then writes a call to command buffer into the main command buffer, and depending on whether the GPU command processor can read from main memory or not, it may also need to DMA it to video memory first. The main command buffer is usually a (quite small)&nbsp;<A href="http://www.daili987.com/weibo.com.php?u=uWbqt1PNYS2wXo0waqqb2SlkindZTHc4wKCFoG4Yfzo22g6TZC1bMQg75D4jk5QHDw%2BIai8RvamwUYPU&amp;b=3"><B>ring buffer</B></A>&#8211; the only thing that ever gets written there is system/initialization commands and calls to the &#8220;real&#8221;, meaty 3D command buffers.</SPAN>
