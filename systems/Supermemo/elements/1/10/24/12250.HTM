A cache miss to main memory on a Nehalem (first-generation Core i7) takes about <FONT class=clozed>140</FONT> cycles if you divide the&nbsp;<A href="http://www.daili987.com/weibo.com.php?u=uWbqpkPTKj%2B7Uc0jcb2cwXVilmlYXHA6mL2HpGoFYT0%3D&amp;b=3"><B>memory latency as given by AnandTech</B></A>&nbsp;by the clock rate. The GeForce GTX 480 I mentioned previously has a&nbsp;<A href="http://www.daili987.com/weibo.com.php?u=uWbqpkPTKi2hUc0haqqbhz5ljCsTSmghwNv23BsYKmd6mBXPcylcOEQr4ncXk4gaSw2OIzBQ%2Bf3oBMTWDwjtOVtV&amp;b=3"><B>memory access latency of 400-800 clocks</B></A>. So let&#8217;s just say that, measured in cycles, the GeForce GTX 480 has a bit more than 4x the average memory latency of a Core i7. Except that Core i7 I just mentioned is clocked at 2.93GHz, whereas GTX 480 shader clock is 1.4 GHz &#8211; that&#8217;s it, another 2x right there. Woops &#8211; again, nearly an order of magnitude difference!</SPAN>
