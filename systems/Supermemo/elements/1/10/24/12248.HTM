But this&#65288;the KMD managed, the actual command buffer&#65289; is still just a buffer in memory right now. Its position is known to the graphics card &#8211; there&#8217;s usually a read pointer, which is where the GPU is in the main command buffer, and a write pointer, which is how far the KMD has written the buffer yet (or more precisely, how far it has told the GPU it has written yet). These are hardware registers, and they are memory-mapped &#8211; the KMD updates them periodically (usually whenever it submits a new chunk of work)&#8230;</SPAN>
