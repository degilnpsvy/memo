<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This is the part that actually deals with the hardware. There may be multiple UMD instances running at any one time, but there&#8217;s only ever one KMD, and if that crashes, then boom you&#8217;re dead &#8211; used to be &#8220;blue screen&#8221; dead, but by now Windows actually knows how to kill a crashed driver and reload it (progress!). As long as it happens to be just a crash and not some kernel memory corruption at least &#8211; if that happens, all bets are off.</SPAN>
