<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">More fun: Some of the API state may actually end up being compiled into the shader &#8211; to give an example, relatively exotic (or at least infrequently used) features such as texture borders are probably not implemented in the texture sampler, but emulated with extra code in the shader (or just not supported at all). This means that there&#8217;s sometimes multiple versions of the same shader floating around, for different combinations of API states.</SPAN>
