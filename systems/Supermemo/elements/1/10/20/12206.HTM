<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Incidentally, this is also the reason why you&#8217;ll often see a delay the first time you use a new shader or resource; a lot of the creation/compilation work is deferred by the driver and only executed when it&#8217;s actually necessary (you wouldn&#8217;t believe how much unused crap some apps create!). Graphics programmers know the other side of the story &#8211; if you want to make sure something is actually created (as opposed to just having memory reserved), you need to issue a dummy draw call that uses it to &#8220;warm it up&#8221;. Ugly and annoying, but this has been the case since I first started using 3D hardware in 1999 &#8211; meaning, it&#8217;s pretty much a fact of life by this point, so get used to it. :)</SPAN>
