<SPAN lang=EN-US style="FONT-SIZE: 16.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In general, drivers will try to put as much of the actual processing into the UMD as possible; the UMD is user-mode code, so anything that runs in it doesn&#8217;t need any costly kernel-mode transitions, it can freely allocate memory, farm work out to multiple threads, and so on &#8211; it&#8217;s just a regular DLL (even though it&#8217;s loaded by the API, not directly by your app). This has advantages for driver development too &#8211; if the UMD crashes, the app crashes with it, but not the whole system; it can just be replaced while the system is running (it&#8217;s just a DLL!); it can be debugged with a regular debugger; and so on. So it&#8217;s not only efficient, it&#8217;s also convenient.</SPAN>
