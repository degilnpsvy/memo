The UMD will get things like texture creation commands and need to provide space for them. Actually, the UMD just suballocates some larger memory blocks it gets from the KMD (kernel-mode driver); actually mapping and unmapping pages (and managing which part of video memory the UMD can see, and conversely which parts of system memory the GPU may access) is a kernel-mode privilege and can&#8217;t be done by the UMD.</SPAN>
