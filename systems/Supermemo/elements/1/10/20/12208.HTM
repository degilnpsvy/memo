Most importantly, it can also write command buffers (or &#8220;DMA buffers&#8221; &#8211; I&#8217;ll be using these two names interchangeably) once the KMD has allocated them and handed them over. A command buffer contains, well, commands :). All your state-changing and drawing operations will be converted by the UMD into commands that the hardware understands. As will a lot of things you don&#8217;t trigger manually &#8211; such as uploading textures and shaders to video memory.</SPAN>
