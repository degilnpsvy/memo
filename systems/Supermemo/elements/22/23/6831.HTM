The command git remote rm removes the given remote and all of its associated remote tracking branches from your local repository. To remove just one remote-tracking branch from your local repository, use a command like this: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>$ git branch -r -d origin/dev </FONT></P>
<P>But you shouldn&#8217;t really do that unless the corresponding remote branch really has been removed from the upstream repository. Otherwise, your next fetch from the upstream repository is likely to recreate the branch again.
