For example, <FONT class=extract>a local topic branch named dev is really a short form of refs/heads/dev</FONT>. <FONT class=extract>Remote tracking branches are in the refs/remotes/ namespace, so origin/master really names refs/remotes/origin/master</FONT>. And finally, <FONT class=extract>a tag such as v2.6.23 is short for refs/tags/v2.6.23</FONT>.
