Running git diff on a conflicted file only shows you the sections that <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN>. In a large file with numerous changes scattered throughout, most of those changes don&#8217;t have a conflict; either one side of the merge changed a particular section or the other side did. When you&#8217;re trying to resolve a conflict, you rarely care about those sections, so git diff trims out uninteresting sections using a simple heuristic: if a section has changes versus only one side, that section isn&#8217;t shown.
