Git&#8217;s internal database efficiently stores every version of every file&#8212;not their differences&#8212;as files go from one revision to the next. Because Git uses the hash of a file&#8217;s complete content as the name for that file, it must operate on each complete copy of the file. It cannot base its work or its object store entries on only part of the file&#8217;s content nor on the differences between two revisions of that file.
