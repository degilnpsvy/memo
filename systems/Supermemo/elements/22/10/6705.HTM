If you start a merge operation but then decide for some reason that you don&#8217;t want to complete it, Git provides an easy way to abort the operation. Prior to executing the final git commit on the merge commit, use: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ <FONT class=clozed>git reset --hard HEAD </FONT></FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>This command restores both your working directory and the index to the state immediately prior to the git merge command.</FONT>
