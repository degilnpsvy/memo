A Git repository is either a bare or a development (nonbare) repository. 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A development repository is used for normal, daily development. It maintains the notion of a current branch and provides a checked out copy of the current branch in a working directory. All of the repositories mentioned in the book so far have been development repositories.</FONT></P>
<P>In contrast, <FONT class=extract>a bare repository has no working directory and shouldn&#8217;t be used for normal development. A bare repository has no notion of a checked out branch, either. Think of a bare repository as simply the contents of the .git directory. In other words, you shouldn&#8217;t make commits in a bare repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>A bare repository might seem to be of little use, but its role is crucial: to serve as an authoritative focal point for collaborative development. Other developers clone and fetch from the bare repository and push updates to it.</FONT>
