You can initiate a git merge request with a dirty working directory, but if you execute git reset --hard then your dirty state prior to the merge is not fully restored. Instead, the reset loses your dirty state in the working directory area. In other words, you requested a --hard reset to the HEAD state! (See &#8220;Using git reset&#8221; on page 154.)
