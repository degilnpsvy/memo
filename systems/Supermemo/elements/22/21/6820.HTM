Git doesn&#8217;t keep information about where a branch originated. Instead, the branch name moves incrementally forward as new commits are made on the branch. Older commits must therefore be named by their hash or via a relative name such as dev~5. If you want to keep track of a particular commit&#8212;because it represents a stable point in the project, say, or is a version you want to test&#8212;you can explicitly assign it a lightweight tag name.
