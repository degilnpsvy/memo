Once a remote is established, Git can transfer data from one repository to another using either a push or a pull model. For example, it&#8217;s common practice to occasionally transfer commit data from an original repository to its clone in order to keep the clone in sync. You can also create a remote to transfer data from the clone to its original or configure the two to exchange information bidirectionally.
