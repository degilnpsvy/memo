As you have seen, the simplest form of Git URL refers to a repository on a local filesystem, be it a true physical filesystem or a virtual filesystem mounted locally via the Network File System (NFS). There are two permutations: </P>
<P>/path/to/repo.git </P>
<P><A href="file:///path/to/repo.git">file:///path/to/repo.git</A> </P>
<P>Although these two formats are essentially identical, there is a subtle but important distinction between the two. The former uses hard links within the filesystem to directly share exactly the same objects between the current and remote repository; the latter copies the objects instead of sharing them directly. To avoid issues associated with shared repositories, the file:// form is recommended.
