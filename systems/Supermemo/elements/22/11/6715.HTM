The repository you&#8217;re currently working in is called the local or current repository, and the repository with which you exchange files is called the remote repository. But the latter term is a bit of a misnomer, because the repository may or may not be on a physically remote or even different machine; it could conceivably be just another repository on a local filesystem. In Chapter 13, I discuss how the term upstream repository is usually used to identify the remote repository from which your local repository is derived via a clone operation.
