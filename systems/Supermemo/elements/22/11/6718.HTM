<FONT class=extract>All the operations that you can perform on a regular topic branch can also be performed on a tracking branch.</FONT> However, there are some restrictions and guidelines to observe. Because remote-tracking branches are used exclusively to follow the changes from another repository, you should effectively treat them as read only. You shouldn&#8217;t merge or make commits onto a remote-tracking branch. Doing so would cause your remote tracking branch to become out of sync with the remote repository. Worse, each future update from the remote repository would likely require merging, making your clone increasingly more difficult to manage. The proper management of tracking branches is covered in more detail later in this chapter.
