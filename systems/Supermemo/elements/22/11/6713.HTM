<FONT class=extract>By default, each new clone maintains a link back to its parent repository via a remote called origin.</FONT> However, the original repository has no knowledge of&#8212;nor does it maintain a link to&#8212;any clone. It is purely a one-way relationship.( 1. Of course, a bidirectional remote relationship can be set up later using the git remote command.)

<P><FONT class=extract>The name &#8220;origin&#8221; isn&#8217;t special in any way. If you don&#8217;t want to use it, simply specify an alternate with the --origin name option during the clone operation.</FONT>
