Git also configures the default origin remote with a default fetch refspec: 
<P></P>
<P>fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</P>
<P>Establishing this refspec anticipates that you want to continue updating your local repository by fetching changes from the originating repository. In this case, the remote repository&#8217;s branches are available in the clone on branch names prefixed with origin/, such as origin/master, origin/dev, or origin/maint.
