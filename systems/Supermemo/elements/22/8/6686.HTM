Note that the git branch command merely introduces <FONT class=clozed>the name of a branch into the repository. It does not change your working directory to use the new branch. No working directory files change, no implicit branch context changes, and no new commits are made. The command simply creates a named branch at the given commit. You can&#8217;t actually start work on the branch until you switch to it, as we show shortly in &#8220;Checking out Branches&#8221; on page 97.</FONT>
