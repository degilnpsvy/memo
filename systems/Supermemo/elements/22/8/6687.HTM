Sometimes you want to specify a different commit as the start of a branch. For instance, suppose that your project creates a new branch for each reported bug and you hear about a bug in a certain release. It may be convenient to use the starting-commit parameter as an alternative to switching your working directory to the branch that represents the release.

<P><FONT class=extract>Normally, your project establishes conventions that let you specify a starting commit with certainty. For instance, to make a bug fix on the Version 2.3 release of your software, you might specify a branch named rel-2.3 as the starting commit: </FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>$ git branch prs/pr-1138 rel-2.3</FONT></P>
<P>The only commit name guaranteed to be unique is the hash ID. If you know a hash ID, you can use it directly: </P>
<P>$ git branch prs/pr-1138 db7de5feebef8bcd18c5356cb47c337236b50c13
