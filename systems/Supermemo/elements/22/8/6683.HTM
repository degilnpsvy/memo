Curiously, you can name a branch and a tag with the same name. If you do, you will have to use their full ref names to distinguish them. For example, you could use refs/tags/v1.0 and refs/heads/v1.0. <FONT class=extract>You may want to use the same name as a branch name during development and then convert it to a tag name at the conclusion of your development.</FONT> Naming branches and tags is ultimately up to you and your project policies. However, <FONT class=extract>you should consider the key differentiating characteristic: is this name static and immutable, or is it dynamic for development? The former should be a tag and the latter a branch.</FONT>
