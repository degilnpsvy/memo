Without additional parameters, only topic branches in the repository are listed. As you&#8217;ll see in Chapter 12, there may be additional remote tracking branches in your repository. You can list those with the <FONT class=clozed>-r</FONT> option. You can list both topic and remote branches with <FONT class=clozed>-a</FONT>.
