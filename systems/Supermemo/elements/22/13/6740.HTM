There are basically three different namespaces represented in refs/: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>refs/heads/ref for your local branches</FONT>, </P>
<P><FONT class=extract>refs/remotes/ref for your remote tracking branches</FONT>, </P>
<P>and <FONT class=extract>refs/tags/ref for your tags</FONT>. </P>
<P>(Branches are covered in more detail in Chapter 7 and in Chapter 12.)
