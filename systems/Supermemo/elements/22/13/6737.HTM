<P>? Check out a commit that is not the head of a branch. </P>
<P>? Check out a tracking branch. You might do this to explore changes recently brought into your repository from a remote repository. </P>
<P>? Check out the commit referenced by a tag. You might do this to put together a release based on tagged versions of files. </P>
