The next object to discuss is the commit. Now that hello.txt has been added with git add and the tree object has been produced with git write-tree, you can create a commit object using low-level commands like this: 
<P></P>
<P>$ echo -n "Commit a file that says hello\n"&nbsp; | git commit-tree 492413269336d21fac079d4a4672e55d5d2147ac
