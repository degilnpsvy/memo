[remote "origin"] </P>
<P>url = /tmp/Depot/public_html</P>
<P>fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</P>
<P>Here, git remote added a new remote section called origin to our configuration. The name origin isn&#8217;t magical or special. You could have used any other name, but the remote that points back to the basis repository is named origin by convention. 
<P>The remote establishes a link from your current repository to the remote repository found, in this case, at /tmp/Depot/public_html.git as recorded in the url value. As a convenience, the .git suffix is not required; both /tmp/Depot/public_html and /tmp/Depot/public_html.git will work. Now, within this repository, the name origin can be used as a shorthand reference for the remote repository found in the depot. Note that a default fetch refspec that follows branch name mapping conventions has also been added.
