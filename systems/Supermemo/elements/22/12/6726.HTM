During a git push operation, you typically want to provide and publish the changes you made on your local topic branches. To allow others to find your changes in the remote repository after you upload them, your changes must appear in that repository as topic branches. <FONT class=extract>Thus, during a typical git push command, the source branches from your repository are sent to the remote repository using a refspec such as:</FONT> 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>+refs/heads/*:refs/heads/*</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>This refspec can be paraphrased as follows: From the local repository, take each branch name found under the source namespace refs/heads/ and place it in a similarly named, matching branch under the destination namespace refs/heads/ in the remote repository.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>The first refs/heads/ refers to your local repository (because you&#8217;re executing a push), and the second refers to the remote repository. The asterisks ensure that all branches are replicated.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>Multiple refspecs may be given on the git fetch and git push command lines. Within a remote definition, multiple fetch refspecs, multiple push refspecs, or a combination of both may be specified.</FONT>
