These steps, however, outline what is necessary to transform a repository into another bare clone repository capable of being the authoritative upstream source repository. The first step is to populate /tmp/Depot with an initial repository. Assuming you want to work on website content that is already established as a Git repository in ~/public_ html, make a copy of the ~/public_html repository and place it in /tmp/Depot/public_html.git.
<P></P>
<P># Assume that ~/public_html is already a Git repository </P>
<P>$ cd /tmp/Depot/ </P>
<P>$ git clone --bare ~/public_html public_html.git</P>
<P>Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/Depot/public_html.git/</P>
<P>This clone command copies the Git remote repository from ~/public_html into the current working directory, /tmp/Depot. The last argument gives the repository a new name, public_html.git. By convention, bare repositories are named with a .git suffix. This is not a requirement, but it is considered a best practice.
