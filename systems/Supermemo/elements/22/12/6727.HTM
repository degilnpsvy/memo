What if you don&#8217;t specify a refspec at all on a git push command? How does Git know what to do or where to send data? 
<P></P>
<P>First, without an explicit remote given to the command, Git assumes <FONT class=clozed>you want to use origin</FONT>. Without a refspec, git push will send your commits to the remote for <FONT class=clozed>all branches that are common between your repository and the upstream repository</FONT>. Any local branch that is not already present in the upstream repository will <FONT class=clozed>not be sent upstream</FONT>; branches must already exist and match names. Thus, new branches must <FONT class=clozed>be explicitly pushed by name</FONT>. Later they can be defaulted with a simple git push. Thus, the default refspec makes the following two commands equivalent:</P>
<P>$ git push origin branch </P>
<P>$ git push origin branch:refs/heads/branch
