Unless some problem prevents a checkout command from completing, the command: 
<P></P>
<P>$ <FONT class=clozed>git checkout -b new-branch start-point</FONT></P>
<P>is exactly the same as the two-command sequence: </P>
<P>$ git branch new-branch start-point </P>
<P>$&nbsp;git checkout new-branch
