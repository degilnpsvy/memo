The syntax of a refspec is: 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=clozed>[+]source:destination </FONT></P>
<P>It consists primarily of a source ref, a colon (:), and a destination ref. The whole format may be prefixed with an optional plus sign (+). If present, the plus sign indicates that <FONT class=clozed>the normal fast-forward safety check will not be performed during the transfer.</FONT> Furthermore, an asterisk (*) allows a limited form of wildcard matching on branch names.
