You can use either a full ref name or its abbreviation, but if you have a branch and a tag with the same name, Git applies a disambiguation heuristic and uses the first match according to this list from the git rev-parse manpage:
<P></P>
<P>.git/ref </P>
<P>.git/refs/ref </P>
<P>.git/refs/tags/ref </P>
<P>.git/refs/heads/ref </P>
<P>.git/refs/remotes/ref </P>
<P>.git/refs/remotes/ref/HEAD
<P>The first rule is usually just for a few refs described later: HEAD, ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD, CHERRY_PICK_HEAD, and MERGE_HEAD.
