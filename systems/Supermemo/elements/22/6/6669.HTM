FETCH_HEAD 
<P></P>
<P><FONT class=extract>When remote repositories are used, git fetch records the heads of all branches fetched in the file .git/FETCH_HEAD.</FONT> <FONT class=extract>FETCH_HEAD is a shorthand for the head of the last branch fetched and is valid only immediately after a fetch operation. Using this symref, you can find the HEAD of commits from git fetch even if an anonymous fetch that doesn&#8217;t specifically name a branch is used.</FONT> The fetch operation is covered in Chapter 12.
