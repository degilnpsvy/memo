<FONT class=extract>In its parameterless form, git log acts like git log HEAD</FONT>, printing the log message associated with every commit in your history that is reachable from HEAD. Changes are shown starting with the HEAD commit and work back through the graph. They are likely to be in roughly reverse chronological order, but recall Git adheres to the commit graph, not time, when traveling back over the history.
