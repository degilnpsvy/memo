And in case you really meant to keep a file that you accidentally removed, simply add it back: 
<P></P>
<P>$ git add data </P>
<P>fatal: pathspec 'data' did not match any files</P>
<P>Darn! Git removed the working copy, too! But don&#8217;t worry. VCSs are good at recovering old versions of files:</P>
<P>$<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>$ cat data </P>
<P>New data</P>
<P>And some more data now </P>
<P>$ git status </P>
<P># On branch master </P>
<P>nothing to commit (working directory clean)
