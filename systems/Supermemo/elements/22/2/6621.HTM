In Git, if the exclusion pattern is somehow specific to your one repository and should not (or might not) be applicable to anyone else&#8217;s clone of your repository, then the patterns should instead go into the<SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN> file, because it is not propagated during clone operations. Its pattern format and treatment is the same as .gitignore files.
