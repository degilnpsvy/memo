If you start a merge operation but then decide for some reason that you don&#8217;t want to complete it, Git provides an easy way to abort the operation. Prior to executing the final git commit on the merge commit, use: 
<P></P>
<P>$ <SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>This command restores both your working directory and the index to the state immediately prior to the git merge command.
