Here&#8217;s another scenario. It&#8217;s typical to exclude .o files, which are generated from source by the compiler. To ignore .o files, place *.o in your top level .gitignore. But what if you also had a particular *.o file that was, say, supplied by someone else and for which you couldn&#8217;t generate a replacement yourself? You&#8217;d likely want to explicitly track that particular file. You might then have a configuration like this: 
<P></P>
<P>$ cd my_package </P>
<P>$ cat .gitignore </P>
<P>*.o </P>
<P>$ cd my_package/vendor_files </P>
<P>$ cat .gitignore </P>
<P><SPAN class=cloze>[...]</SPAN></P>
<P>The combination of rules means that Git will ignore all .o files within the repository but will track one exception, the file driver.o within the vendor_files subdirectory.
