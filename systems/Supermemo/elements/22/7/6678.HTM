In fact, Git doesn&#8217;t really care about the time or timing (absolute or relative) of commits. The actual &#8220;wall clock&#8221; time of a commit can be misleading because a computer&#8217;s clock can be set incorrectly or inconsistently. Within a distributed development environment, the problem is exacerbated. Time stamps can&#8217;t be trusted. What is certain, though, is that if commit Y points to parent X, then X captures the repository state prior to the repository state of commit Y, regardless of what time stamps might be on the commits.
