Git supports other abbreviations and combinations as well. The abbreviated forms C^ and C~ are the same as C^1 and C~1, respectively. Also, C^^ is the same as C^1^1 and, because that means the &#8220;first parent of the first parent of commit C,&#8221; it refers to the same commit as <FONT class=clozed>C~2</FONT>.
