Normally, your project establishes conventions that let you specify a starting commit with certainty. For instance, to make a bug fix on the Version 2.3 release of your software, you might specify a branch named rel-2.3 as the starting commit: 
<P></P>
<P>$ <FONT class=clozed>git branch prs/pr-1138 rel-2.3</FONT>
